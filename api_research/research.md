# Executive Summary of API Stack (2025)

Building a near-real-time **Semiconductor Trade Monitor** requires integrating multiple data sources. Our recommended stack combines **free official APIs** for broad coverage with **specialized commercial data** for granular, real-time insights. Key trade flow data will come from: **UN Comtrade** (global HS6 trade stats, monthly), **U.S. ITC DataWeb** (detailed U.S. HTS10 trade, monthly) and **Eurostat Comext** (EU trade at CN8, monthly). These are augmented by **national sources** (Taiwan and Korea customs data) for timely regional stats. For supply-chain visibility, **Panjiva or ImportGenius** APIs provide bill-of-lading level shipment data (daily updates for key routes). Macro context comes from **FRED** (Fed economic data) and **World Bank/IMF** APIs (trade balances, GDP) – all free with high reliability. **Geopolitical signals** are captured via **GDELT** (news events, updated \~15-minutes) and potentially **Reuters/Bloomberg** news feeds (for industry headlines, via paid plans). User management and platform operations are handled by **Auth0** (for OAuth user logins and API key issuance), **Stripe** (for subscription billing in USD), and **SendGrid/Twilio** (for email/SMS notifications). Deployment uses **cloud PaaS (Fly.io/Railway)** for agility, with monitoring by **Datadog/New Relic** for uptime and error tracking. This multi-tier approach balances **cost-efficiency** (maximizing free data) with **comprehensiveness** (using commercial APIs for real-time, HS-10 detail). The table below summarizes the core APIs, followed by in-depth analyses, integration strategy, cost and risk assessments, and an implementation roadmap.

**Table Notes:** All costs are in **USD**. “Free” refers to no direct fee for API usage (aside from infrastructure to call it); commercial APIs incur significant fees. *Update Frequency* indicates how often new data is available. *Coverage* highlights geographic scope and data resolution (e.g. HS code detail). *Auth* = Authentication. More details and sources are provided in the sections below.

## Detailed API Analyses

### 1. Primary Trade Data APIs (Official Sources)

These are authoritative government sources for trade statistics, covering the key HS codes (854232 memory, 854231/854239 GPUs, 848620 lithography, etc.) and partner flows (e.g. S. Korea↔Taiwan, Taiwan↔USA, Netherlands↔Taiwan). They ensure broad coverage and data integrity for the platform.

#### UN Comtrade API (United Nations)

* **Status (2025):** **Active** – Comtrade launched a new API (v1) on `comtradeapi.un.org`. The legacy API is being phased out in favor of the new system. As of 2025 it is fully operational and supported.
* **Authentication:** Requires an **API Key** (subscription key) for full access. Users can register on the UN Comtrade portal for a **free API key** (two keys provided per account). A **“Preview”** mode exists for testing small queries without a key, but production use requires the key in the `subscription-key` header or URL. Multiple tiers (free vs premium) share the same endpoints with different rate limits.
* **Rate Limits:** The free tier allows a moderate call volume (approx. **100 requests/minute** by convention, though not explicitly documented on Comtrade site). Large data pulls are constrained by result size: maximum **50,000 records per query** on the legacy API (the new API may allow slightly more, but best practice is to page through results). Premium subscribers can get higher throughput and possibly bulk access.
* **Data Freshness:** **No fixed schedule** for updates. Comtrade posts data as soon as national statistical offices report it. In practice, data is typically **2–3 months delayed** for many countries. (E.g. a country’s June 2025 data might appear by Aug/Sep 2025.) There is no guarantee of real-time (<12h) updates; Comtrade is for **official statistics** rather than live data.
* **Coverage:** Virtually **global** – 200+ reporting countries/territories from 1962 onward. Data includes **annual and monthly trade**. Product detail is typically at **HS 6-digit** level (the international standard). Some reporters provide national extensions (e.g. EU CN8, US 10-digit) but Comtrade generally harmonizes to 6-digit for comparability. It covers both **imports and exports** by partner country. Key semiconductor-related HS codes (8542 etc.) are supported at 6-digit, though not the full 10-digit detail.
* **Schema & Endpoints:** The new API uses RESTful endpoints. For example:

  ```http
  https://comtradeapi.un.org/data/v1/get/C/M/HS?freq=M&px=HS&ps=202304&r=410&p=490&rg=1&cc=854232
  ```

  This would request monthly HS data for reporter 410 (Rep. of Korea) partner 490 (Taiwan) imports (rg=1) for HS code 854232 in April 2023. The response is JSON (by default) with records containing trade values, quantities, etc. The schema includes fields like `rtCode` (reporter), `ptCode` (partner), `cmdCode` (commodity code), `TradeValue` etc. Metadata endpoints exist for HS code descriptions, country codes, etc.
* **Historical Data:** Full historical data is available (back to 1962 for many countries). The API and **bulk download** service allow retrieving large archives. Bulk downloads (CSV) can be done by year/country on the UN Comtrade website for offline analysis (useful as a backup if the API is too slow).
* **Update Schedule:** While not fixed, Comtrade’s **recent releases page** shows updates almost daily for different countries. Users must monitor the release calendar or poll the API’s **“getLiveUpdate”** endpoint for newly published data. There is no subscription push, so our platform will likely need a daily check routine.
* **Subscription & Pricing:** **Free** to use with registration. The UN is moving toward a freemium model: basic data access is free, but heavy users or those needing advanced features (like very large queries or enhanced support) might require a paid subscription. (As of 2025, specifics of paid tiers are not fully public – likely custom enterprise agreements.) No per-call fees for moderate use. This makes Comtrade extremely cost-effective for global coverage.
* **Documentation Quality:** Moderate. Official docs are provided via an online user guide (on UN Stats wiki) and some StackOverflow/wiki answers. The docs outline endpoints, parameters, and examples, but some features (like advanced filtering, or new features) are not well-publicized. We have to infer some usage from community libraries (e.g. the `comtradr` R package docs) and the interactive API portal. Overall, the documentation is somewhat fragmented but improving.
* **Reliability:** Uptime is generally good (UN Comtrade is hosted on a stable cloud infrastructure). However, large or complex queries can time out or be rejected (HTTP 500 errors if too much data). Also, when many users hit the API (e.g. around yearly data releases), there might be slowdowns. There’s no formal SLA. Our platform should implement **retry and caching** for Comtrade requests.
* **Integration Complexity:** Easy to integrate via REST calls. The main complexity is handling the pagination of results and combining data if our query exceeds record limits. Several client libraries exist (Python’s `comtrade` library, R’s `comtradr`, etc.) to simplify usage, or we can use direct HTTP calls with our API key in headers. Example in Python using the `requests` library:

  ```python
  import requests
  headers = {"subscription-key": "YOUR_COMTRADE_KEY"}
  url = ("https://comtradeapi.un.org/data/v1/get/C/M/HS?"
         "freq=M&px=HS&ps=202301&reporterCode=410&partnerCode=840&cmdCode=854232")
  resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
  data = resp.json()
  trade_value = data['dataset'][0]['observations'][0]['value']  # first record's trade value
  ```

  The above fetches South Korea’s exports of HS 854232 to the USA in Jan 2023. We would build similar queries dynamically. In sum, integration is straightforward REST; the heavy lifting is in data cleaning/joining if needed.
* **Legal:**
  Comtrade data is **open for use**. The terms require citing “UN Comtrade” as the source in any published analysis. There is no personal data involved. As an official UN database, it can be used in a commercial product (Comtrade encourages widespread use) with attribution. We must avoid hammering the API (respect rate limits) and not resell the raw data as-is (our usage is transformative – analytics platform – which is allowed).
* **Backup Options:** If Comtrade is slow or temporarily down, we have alternatives:

  * **Direct national sources**: e.g. US Census trade API, EU Comext, national statistical releases. We are already planning to use those alongside.
  * **UN Comtrade Bulk CSV**: We can pre-download key datasets (e.g. last 5 years of trade for the HS codes of interest) and store locally. This mitigates reliance on the live API for historical data.
  * **WTO or ITC data**: Some aggregated figures can be obtained from the WTO or ITC Trade Map if needed in a pinch, but these ultimately derive from Comtrade.

In summary, **UN Comtrade** provides comprehensive global trade coverage (essential for our “all the world” requirement) with no direct cost. Its drawbacks are the lack of very timely data and limited HS granularity. We will use it mainly for historical baselines, broad country comparisons, and as a **secondary source** when national APIs are unavailable for certain countries.

#### U.S. Census/ITC DataWeb API (USA Trade Data)

* **Status:** **Active** – The U.S. Census Bureau and USITC provide trade data via the **DataWeb API** (sometimes called the Census API for trade). As of 2025, DataWeb is on version 5, fully operational. It’s regularly updated with monthly U.S. trade statistics and maintained by USITC (with Census data).
* **Authentication:** Requires a **free user account** on DataWeb and obtaining an **API token**. The token is used as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for API calls. There are separate environments for testing (development) vs production usage of the API. No paid key is needed; it’s public data.
* **Rate Limits:** No strict published call-per-second limit. The main limitation is on **query size/rows**. Downloads are capped at **300,000 rows per query** (the system may allow slightly more during off-peak, but never above Excel’s \~1 million row limit). Practically, that means if a query would return more than 300k data points (e.g. a very detailed query over many years), you must break it into smaller chunks (by year or product group). The API might also have a rate throttle to prevent abuse (e.g. anecdotal evidence suggests keeping it to < 60 calls/minute to be safe). We can batch our calls or use the saved query mechanism to optimize.
* **Data Freshness:** **Monthly official trade data**, typically released with a \~6 week lag. For example, May 2025 data was released in early July 2025. The API data is updated soon after the official release (the DataWeb site indicated data through May 2025 is available). The API can sometimes be unavailable during data loading periods (they note an error “Dataweb is in data load mode” will appear during updates). So within 48 hours of Census release, the API has the new data – well within our 48h requirement. (However, not <12h real-time; U.S. trade stats are monthly, not daily, by nature.)
* **Coverage:** All **U.S. merchandise trade** – imports and exports. Data is very granular: by **10-digit HTS code** (Harmonized Tariff Schedule, U.S. specific codes) which is effectively HS-6 plus four national digits. It covers **1989-present** monthly trade. We get partner country detail, trade value in USD, quantity, and other dimensions (e.g. customs district, modes of transport if using certain classification systems). This is crucial for our HBM/GPU/lithography monitoring, as we can retrieve specific 10-digit codes (if known) for those products in U.S. imports/exports. If not, we can use 854232 etc. at 6-digit or 8-digit. The system allows using **“HTS” classification** for detailed codes or other classification like SITC, etc..
* **Schema & API Structure:** The DataWeb API is a bit complex: it uses JSON payloads to define queries (there is a `runReport` endpoint). One can build a query by specifying parameters like `reportOptions` (trade flow, classification, etc.), `valueOptions` (whether to include value/quantity), and filters for year, commodities, countries, etc. Alternatively, one can create a query via the web UI and then use the API to retrieve it by an ID. For direct use, an easier way is the **DataWeb API v2 Endpoints**:

  * `GET /api/v2/savedQuery/getAllSavedQueries` – list queries.
  * `POST /api/v2/report2/runReport` – execute a specified query JSON and return results.

  The response contains data in JSON, nested under `dto.tables` with `rowsNew` etc.. We will likely wrap this in our own code to extract rows into a simple table. Example: retrieving total U.S. exports to Taiwan for HS 854232 in 2024 might involve constructing a query with classification = HTS, commodity = 85423200 (if that’s the 8-digit or 10-digit code for HBM memory), reporter = USA, partner = Taiwan, and summing the value. The DataWeb documentation provides examples and even sample Python code for forming queries. We may leverage their examples to speed up integration.
* **Bulk Access:** The API doesn’t have a one-shot “download all” for very large data (hence 300k row limit). However, because it’s free, we could programmatically page through data (e.g. get one HS code at a time, or one year at a time). Also, the USITC site allows manual download of query results in CSV. For our purposes, we might periodically pull specific HS codes of interest (which will yield far less than 300k rows anyway, given maybe monthly data for a handful of countries).
* **Pricing:** **Free.** There are no costs to using this API. It’s provided as a public service. No subscription needed, and no paywall for more data. This makes it extremely cost-effective.
* **Documentation:** **Good.** USITC provides a comprehensive **API User Guide** and interactive documentation (Swagger UI). They include Python examples in the docs (as seen in the snippet we found) and detailed explanations of each parameter. In addition, the DataWeb interface itself can help build queries which we can then run via API, reducing guesswork. Community support is limited but the official docs suffice.
* **Reliability:** Generally high. The DataWeb API is managed by a U.S. government agency with robust infrastructure. Downtimes are rare outside maintenance windows. If issues arise, they are usually resolved quickly (the agencies have vested interest as many analysts rely on DataWeb). We should watch out for the noted downtime during data loads (likely a few hours once a month). Also, occasionally a query might fail if it’s poorly constructed or too large – but that’s a client issue more than server reliability.
* **Integration:** Medium complexity. Because the API expects a JSON query object, integrating isn’t as simple as constructing a URL with parameters (unlike, say, FRED). However, once we build a query template for our needs (e.g. a template for “trade by HS code X between country A and B over period Y-Z”), it’s straightforward to submit and parse the JSON. We might create a small wrapper in Python for this. The **Swagger UI** and the provided code samples will be useful in development. The API returns JSON that we need to navigate (the actual data is nested a few levels down). We will likely convert that to a pandas DataFrame for analysis. Example pseudo-code:

  ```python
  import requests, json
  # Construct query JSON for exports of HS 854232 to Taiwan in 2024
  query = {
      "reportOptions": {
          "tradeType": "Export", "classificationSystem": "HTS"
      },
      "dataItems": [
          {"code": "854232", "hierarchy": "HS10"},  # commodity code (HS10 or HS6 etc.)
          {"code": "TW", "hierarchy": "Country"}    # partner country code (TW for Taiwan)
      ],
      "valueOptions": {"IncludeValue": True, "IncludeVolume": False},
      "timeframe": {"startDate": "2024-01", "endDate": "2024-12"}
  }
  headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}
  resp = requests.post(baseUrl+"/api/v2/report2/runReport", json=query, headers=headers)
  data = resp.json()
  # Extract trade value from data['dto']['tables'][0]... (parse as needed)
  ```

  This illustrates the process. In reality, we might use the saved query approach: set up a query via the web UI, save it, then call it by ID – simpler once initial setup is done.
* **Legal:** The data is **public domain** (U.S. government data). We can use it freely in our platform, even commercially. There is no requirement for attribution legally, though it’s good practice to note “Source: U.S. Census Bureau via USITC DataWeb”. One must not misrepresent the data or imply endorsement. Also, we should ensure user privacy (but this dataset contains no personal info, only aggregated trade values).
* **Backup:** If for some reason DataWeb API were down, alternatives include:

  * **USA Trade Online** (Census’s own online tool) – not an API, but we could manually retrieve data.
  * **UN Comtrade** – U.S. data is also in Comtrade (at HS-6), albeit less detailed and possibly slightly different timing.
  * **Panjiva/ImportGenius** – they have all U.S. import records too, which could be aggregated to get similar totals (though that’s more for contingency, since official stats are easier).
  * But given DataWeb’s reliability, backup use will be rare. We might still cache recent data in our database so the platform isn’t helpless if the API is briefly unreachable.

#### Eurostat Comext API (EU Trade Statistics)

* **Status:** **Active** – The EU’s **Comext** database is accessible via a special Eurostat API endpoint. In 2025, this is fully functional and updated monthly. (Eurostat’s API got an upgrade with an asynchronous option for large datasets, which is relevant for Comext due to data size.) The Comext data is not deprecated; it’s the official source for detailed EU trade.
* **Authentication:** **No API key required.** Eurostat’s APIs are open to the public. You can query data directly. However, if you pull extremely large datasets, they might throttle or ask you to use the bulk download service. For normal usage (even thousands of calls per day), no auth or account is needed. This is great for a free access approach.
* **Rate Limits:** Eurostat doesn’t impose strict call limits, but they do mention that very large queries should use the **asynchronous API** (which provides a job ID and you poll for results). This implies a de-facto limit on sync calls. If we stick to moderately filtered queries (e.g. one country’s trade for a set of HS codes, or all EU for one HS code), it should be fine. The API is robust – e.g. updated twice daily and can handle frequent requests. In practice, to avoid any implicit limits, we can insert short delays between calls or cache results.
* **Data Freshness:** **Monthly data**, updated on a regular schedule. Eurostat updates datasets at **11:00 and 23:00 CET daily** if new data is available. Specifically for trade (Comext), each month’s data for EU member states is usually released around 6 weeks after month-end (similar to national schedules). Eurostat’s Comext domain is updated monthly. They also release an EU aggregate earlier as a press release, but for product-level, it’s monthly. So our platform can expect EU data within 4–6 weeks of the reference month – not as fast as 48h, but that’s due to statistical practice. (We might rely on national sources like country press releases for more timely hints if needed.)
* **Coverage:** **All EU Member States** (27 countries currently) plus some extra-European countries’ data (Eurostat Comext also hosts some non-EU countries’ detailed data for convenience). It includes **Intra-EU trade** (flows between member states) and **Extra-EU trade** (with outside countries). Data is by **Combined Nomenclature 8-digit (CN8)**, which is the EU’s product classification (CN8 aligns with HS6 for the first 6 digits, with 2 extra digits). This is very detailed – e.g. CN8 can distinguish specific semiconductor products better than HS6 in some cases. We’ll definitely use CN8 codes for things like specific memory types if needed. Geographic detail includes trade by partner country (for extra-EU trade; for intra-EU, partner is each member state). Time coverage is extensive (monthly data back to early 2000s, annual further back).
* **Schema & Access:** The Comext data is provided via Eurostat’s SDMX API. The base endpoint is `https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/comext/dissemination/` for Comext datasets. You typically need to know the dataset code. For example, there are dataset codes like:

  * DS-045409 (possibly one for monthly trade by HS2/HS4?), etc. According to Eurostat, one can list all Comext datasets via a query.
  * Once the dataset is identified (e.g. one that contains monthly trade by CN8), you can retrieve data by specifying filters for year/month, product, reporter, etc. The API supports **SDMX format (XML/JSON)** and also a simpler **JSON-stat** or **CSV** format by adding format parameters.
  * Example call (illustrative):

    ```
    https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/comext/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/DS-045409/..EU27..HS4=8542?time=2023M01
    ```

    This is not a real endpoint, just to show structure: typically it’s dataset code, then key fields separated by dots (Eurostat’s API is a bit complex in syntax). But they do allow pulling by HS code and time. We might fetch, say, “all CN8 codes under 8542 for Netherlands exports to world in Jan 2025.” The result can be JSON-stat which is easier to parse.
  * If the data volume is huge (all CN8 for all countries for all months), the API will reject it. We will always query with filters (specific HS codes and/or specific reporter countries) to keep results manageable.
* **Bulk/Async:** Eurostat explicitly **disables full dataset download via API** for Comext because of size. Instead, they offer monthly **bulk CSV files** on their website for the Comext domain. These CSVs are updated monthly and contain data by product and partner. As a backup strategy, we could download those files (they are large, but we could handle it) for an offline store, especially if we need historical EU data quickly. But for day-to-day, using the API with selective queries (our HS codes of interest) is more efficient.
* **Cost:** **Free.** All Eurostat data is open access, under the EU’s open data license which allows commercial use with attribution. There are no API fees or tiers. This significantly keeps our costs down while getting high-quality data.
* **Documentation:** **Detailed.** Eurostat provides an API user guide (with sections on Comext), including how to format queries for DS- datasets. There is also a FAQ and examples on their website. It’s a bit technical due to SDMX, but examples are available. The learning curve is moderate, but once understood, the API is powerful. We also have external resources (like the GitHub project in search results about automating monthly EU trade downloads) which indicate dataset codes and methods others have used.
* **Reliability:** Very high. Eurostat’s API is known to be stable with strong uptime. In 2025, the infrastructure is cloud-based and handles many requests. On rare occasions, it might be slow if extremely large data is requested or if maintenance is occurring (they post maintenance schedules on the site). Because no API key is needed, we must be mindful not to overload it from our side (to avoid HTTP 429 throttling). But normal use is fine.
* **Integration:** Medium. We need to handle SDMX/JSON-stat data, which can be a bit tricky. However, Eurostat’s JSON-stat format is quite usable – it provides a structured JSON with dimension labels and values. We might use a library like `pandasdmx` or simply requests + manual parsing. We should also implement the **async pattern** for large queries: the API might return a 202 Accepted with a link to retrieve results when ready. Implementing that adds complexity but only if we request large data. Given we’ll filter by specific codes and countries, we may not need async – synchronous calls might suffice. For integration, we’ll likely pick the JSON format to avoid dealing with XML. Example (pseudo-code):

  ```python
  url = ("https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/comext/dissemination/odata/v2.1/DS-123456"
         "?$filter=ProductCn8 eq '85423200' and Partner eq 'TW' and Period eq '202401'")
  resp = requests.get(url)
  data = resp.json()
  # parse data['value'] which might be a list of records
  ```

  (Note: Eurostat also offers an OData interface for some datasets – which can be easier to use with filters as above, if available for Comext). We’ll confirm the best method during implementation. Overall, integration is doable with moderate effort.
* **Legal:** **Open data license (EU)** – essentially “free reuse with attribution.” We should mention somewhere on our platform that some data is from Eurostat. There are no restrictions on commercial use. Just be cautious with personal data (not applicable here, since it’s aggregate trade data).
* **Backup:** If the API is down or we need data beyond its query limits, the **monthly CSV exports** are our backup. We can download, for example, the entire 2024 trade file and query it locally for specific CN8 codes. Another backup is **National sources**: Each EU country also publishes its trade data (e.g. Germany’s DESTATIS or France’s customs), but that’s unnecessary if Eurostat is available. The Comext one-stop source is efficient. We will likely mirror key data in our database so even if Eurostat is offline temporarily, our users see recent data.

#### Taiwan Ministry of Finance Trade Data (Customs Statistics)

* **Status:** **Active** – Taiwan’s customs trade statistics system is operational and provides timely data via a web portal. However, **there is no public REST API** widely documented. The MOF provides an online interface (“Trade Statistics Database”) and some open data downloads for specific reports. As of 2025, the MOF has signaled plans to offer more **open APIs** for customs data, but access is currently through their **“Single Window”** portal and datasets. We will treat it as an available data source albeit not a straightforward API integration.
* **Access & Authentication:** The primary access is through the **Taiwan customs trade statistics portal**. One can interactively query trade by HS code, country, time period, etc., and download results (usually in XLS). This requires no login for basic queries. For automation, we could attempt to simulate requests (the site might run on a POST form). Alternatively, the government open data platform (**data.gov.tw**) hosts some trade datasets (e.g. top products by country) that can be accessed via their API. For example, some dataset listings show “provided via API” on data.gov.tw (though many are for aggregated reports rather than raw data). If an official API exists, it may require an application with the customs IT department (the article suggests expanding open API offerings). For now, likely **no API key** required because no formal API – we may either scrape or use open data files.
* **Rate Limits:** Not applicable as no formal API. If we scrape the portal, we must throttle ourselves to not overwhelm their server. The open data portal (data.gov.tw) generally allows a decent amount of calls if using their API for available datasets, but it depends on the dataset. We might just use a once-a-month retrieval (which is very low frequency) for Taiwan data, so rate limiting is not a concern.
* **Data Freshness:** **Very timely.** Taiwan publishes **preliminary monthly trade** about **9 days after month-end** (e.g. preliminary June 2025 on July 9, 2025) and **final detailed data around the 15th of the following month**. This is well within our 48h goal after customs release, actually much faster – one of the fastest reporting economies. For our needs (especially Taiwan ↔ others semiconductor trade), this is critical. We will likely use the detailed data released mid-month (which includes breakdown by HS code and country). So by \~15th each month, we have the prior month’s complete data.
* **Coverage:** **Taiwan’s total exports and imports**, by commodity and country. The level of detail: Taiwan uses its own 8-digit or 10-digit codes (likely similar to HS8). The portal provides data at least at the HS 4-digit and 6-digit level, possibly 8-digit if you have the code. We know at least HS6 is available publicly. It covers all trade, including sensitive tech. For instance, Taiwan’s “exports of HS 854232 to South Korea” monthly – we expect to get that. The data includes values in NT dollars and USD typically (the site shows values in NT\$ which can be converted, or maybe directly in USD). They also provide cumulative year-to-date. We will focus on monthly flows in USD for consistency.
* **Data Schema:** From the portal UI, one can select fields: year/month, HS code, country. The output is a table of value (and maybe quantity). We don’t have a JSON, but likely the backend is querying a database. Without an official API, our integration might involve either **downloading an Excel each month** or using an unofficial API. There is a hint that the Single Window might have an API endpoint (because other parts of the Single Window have API). For example, the URL we accessed `GA35` might accept parameters. Another approach: the open data portal might have a dataset like “Monthly trade by HS by country” – if that exists with an API endpoint, that solves it. We should investigate data.gov.tw for relevant datasets. For example, one search result indicated a dataset being removed because it duplicated the info on the GA35 site – suggesting that previously there was a dataset for trade statistics. It’s possible the removal means we have to use GA35 site directly.
* **Integration Approach:** If no official API, we have a few options:

  1. Use **Python automation** (Requests/selenium) to log in or directly post form data to the GA35 endpoint and retrieve results. Some have done this (Stack Overflow Q: “How to login on Trademap with Python?” – similar concept). We’d need to figure out the form parameters (maybe using browser dev tools). This is brittle but feasible for monthly tasks.
  2. Use **data.gov.tw API**: The open data platform might have an API if we find the right dataset. We saw references to datasets such as “進出口貿易值\_按HS及主要國別” (Trade values by HS and country). If available, we could use that JSON API. Often, data.gov.tw returns JSON or CSV if you hit a specific URL with the dataset ID and an API key (which can be obtained freely). We did not find a direct dataset because possibly it was deprecated. But maybe updated ones exist.
  3. As a fallback, manually download the monthly trade Excel (MOF publishes monthly press releases and data files, possibly on MOF or customs website).

  Given the importance, we may invest some dev time to get this automated. The volume is not huge (one file per month).
* **Pricing:** **Free.** Taiwan’s government data is free. The open data portal license is similar to CC-BY. No fees for access. It’s just a matter of technical effort due to lack of official API endpoints.
* **Documentation:** Minimal (for API). The portal has an English guide and FAQ explaining how to use the website. But no API docs publicly. If we contact the MOF, we might get info on whether they have an API for developers. The news article we saw from Customs suggests an initiative to expand open APIs, possibly by end of 2022. It’s worth checking if by 2025 they quietly introduced something. However, for now, plan with what we know.
* **Reliability:** High for data accuracy (official statistics). The website uptime is generally good. The biggest risk is that automation might break if the site’s HTML changes or if they block automated queries. However, since it’s public data, as long as we’re gentle (like one query per month), it should be fine. There’s no alternative source for Taiwan’s detailed trade except UN Comtrade (but that has Taiwan aggregated at HS6 and often with a lag, as Taiwan is not a UN member, their data might get into Comtrade slower or via partner data). So, ensuring we reliably get it from MOF is key.
* **Integration Complexity:** Relatively **high** (compared to standard APIs). We might have to resort to web-scraping techniques. This requires handling possibly a login token or at least replicating the form submission. The “Database Query” might use an ASP.NET form (looking at `portal.sw.nat.gov.tw`). We saw the portal page GA35, which likely expects parameters like year, month, HS code. We could try to find if a hidden API exists by analyzing network calls in a browser. In any case, implementing this will be a custom solution with potential need for maintenance. It’s not plug-and-play REST. On the plus side, since we only need to do it monthly (or maybe also year-to-date), it’s not a high-frequency job. We can schedule a script to fetch new data when available. We will also store the results in our database for quick queries on our platform.
* **Legal:** The data is public. We should attribute “Ministry of Finance, R.O.C. (Taiwan)”. There are no personal data concerns. We should comply with any usage terms (likely, do not excessively scrape or misuse data). Given it’s aggregate trade stats, usage in our product is acceptable.
* **Backup:** If our automated fetch fails, as a backup we can:

  * Manually retrieve the data from the MOF website (in the worst case, someone on our team downloads the Excel and uploads it – not ideal, but an emergency fallback).
  * Use **UN Comtrade**: it does have data for “Taiwan, Province of China” (though the MOF might not provide it to UN since Taiwan’s status is unique). Actually, Taiwan’s data might not be in Comtrade because of political issues. We can rely on partner data (e.g. other countries reporting trade with Taiwan) if absolutely necessary, but that’s not as direct or timely.
  * In short, we’ll want to robustly get it ourselves.

#### Korea Customs Service API (South Korea)

* **Status:** **Active** – Korea provides open data for customs statistics through its national **Open Data Portal** (data.go.kr). Specifically, there are **Open APIs** for trade figures (we found one for country-level exports/imports, and references to others). As of 2025, these APIs are operational, having last been updated in mid-2025. So South Korea does have a formal API to tap into, which is great.

* **Authentication:** Requires obtaining an **API key** from data.go.kr (Korean Open Government Data portal). This involves signing up for a free account and subscribing to the dataset’s API. The portal then provides an **App Key/Secret** or just an API key (depending on API type). Typically, for open data APIs, you include a `serviceKey` parameter or an `Authorization` header. In our snippet for port data, the `serviceKey` was an essential param. So yes, we’ll need to register for the “관세청 수출입실적 API” to get our key – which is free. The key might have a development vs production state (often you have to apply for production after testing).

* **Rate Limits:** According to the portal, for the **country-level trade API**, the default is **10,000 calls/day** for a development account and higher if you register a use-case for production. For example, the portal says “development account: 10,000, operational: can increase upon request”. So we have a comfortable daily allowance. We likely won’t need that many – maybe a few calls per day (one per HS code or so). So no issues anticipated. If we ever needed more (e.g. pulling a lot of historical data initially), we could request higher quota by explaining our project to the data.go.kr admins. Response sizes are typically small JSON or XML for aggregated results, which is fine.

* **Data Freshness:** **Monthly data**, updated promptly. South Korea usually releases trade data within \~1 month after month-end. The API description notes that adjustments (corrections/cancellations) are reflected around the 15th of each month for the previous month’s data, implying by mid-month the last month’s data is finalized on the API. Indeed, Korean Customs releases preliminary monthly figures even earlier (the famous first-day-of-month export numbers), but detailed by HS likely follows a bit later. By the 15th, we should have full detail – which meets our needs. The API’s mention suggests it’s updated monthly with any revisions incorporated by mid-month. We should monitor their schedule; likely we can retrieve data perhaps as early as the first week of the month (for preliminary) and again after the 15th (for final).

* **Coverage:** **South Korea’s import/export data**, presumably at least by HS code and possibly by country. The specific API we saw (국가별 수출입실적) is for **country-level aggregates** – i.e. total exports/imports by partner country (without commodity detail, just totals). That is useful for overall trade but not enough for our purposes by itself. We need commodity detail. Does KCS offer an API for commodity-by-country? Possibly “품목별” (by product) API is not publicly open due to data volume. If not available directly, we might need to combine sources:

  * We could get **country-level totals from the API** to know overall trends.
  * For commodity detail, we might rely on UN Comtrade for Korea (which has HS6 data, albeit with a lag).
  * Or see if KCS open data portal has downloadable files for commodity detail. There might be datasets like “Exports by HS by country (monthly)” on data.go.kr as file downloads (like Excel or CSV).

  We should check data.go.kr for other relevant datasets. The search result snippet included “시도별 성질별 수출입실적” (by province and nature of goods). Possibly there's also one for “품목별”. If none, we may rely on Comtrade for detailed breakdown or acquire data from KITA (Korea International Trade Association) if needed (KITA has a trade stats system too). In any event, we do have at least the **aggregate by country API** which can tell us total trade with, say, Taiwan or USA, near-real-time.

  In summary, coverage via APIs:

  * **Country-level**: Yes (monthly exports/imports by partner available through API).
  * **HS-level**: Might require combining data (could get HS-level totals to world, or by broad category via another API or dataset).
  * Note: since our focus is specific high-tech products, we might try to get “exports of 854232 (memory) to all partners”. If KCS doesn’t offer that via open API, alternative is Comtrade (with some lag), or perhaps KITA’s monthly reports (KITA often publishes top export items).

* **Data Schema:** The country-level API returns fields such as period (month), country code, exports value, imports value, trade balance, etc.. The response can be in XML or JSON (the portal example was XML by default, but often you can request JSON format). For example, an XML snippet might look like:

  ```xml
  <item>
    <period>2023-06</period>
    <country_code>US</country_code>
    <country_name>United States</country_name>
    <export_value>XXXX</export_value>
    <import_value>YYYY</import_value>
    <trade_balance>ZZZZ</trade_balance>
  </item>
  ```

  We can parse this easily. For other APIs (if any) the schema would differ accordingly (product code, etc.). The portal provided a **Swagger-like interface** (images in \[37] show swagger screenshots), indicating well-defined fields. The **reference code file** mentioned (관세청조회코드\_v1.1.xlsx) likely lists code values for countries, HS codes, etc., which is handy. We will likely use country codes like “US” for United States (as in the example) and presumably HS codes in strings for any product API.

* **Integration:** Straightforward. The data.go.kr APIs are standard REST endpoints with query parameters. For example, for country trade:

  ```
  GET http://apis.data.go.kr/1220000/CountryTrade/getCountryTradeList?
      serviceKey=YOUR_KEY&strtYymm=202301&endYymm=202312&countryCode=TW
  ```

  (This is constructed based on patterns from \[37] and \[41].) This would retrieve monthly trade with Taiwan in 2023. The API documentation (in Korean) will confirm parameter names. We might have to URL-encode the serviceKey or use the new `Authorization: Bearer` approach if supported. But usually serviceKey in URL is accepted. Once we get the XML/JSON, parsing is trivial in Python (`requests.get().json()` if JSON or using `xml.etree` for XML). Example code:

  ```python
  import requests
  url = "http://apis.data.go.kr/1220000/CountryTrade/getCountryTradeList"
  params = {
      "serviceKey": MY_API_KEY,
      "strtYymm": "202301",
      "endYymm": "202312",
      "countryCode": "TW"
  }
  resp = requests.get(url, params=params)
  data = resp.json()  # if JSON requested
  for item in data['response']['body']['items']:
      print(item['period'], item['export_value'], item['import_value'])
  ```

  This would print the monthly values for 2023. We’ll integrate similarly, adjusting queries for needed HS or other endpoints if available. If HS-specific API is not open, integration complexity rises (we’d need to get data another way, see backup). But for what is provided, integration is easy and well-documented (the portal lists all input fields in English as well).

* **Reliability:** Good. The Korean open data portal is robust and the services are maintained by the government. Many developers use data.go.kr for various data; it has a support center if issues arise. The main reliability factor is ensuring our key remains valid (they sometimes require re-confirmation of use each year). We should monitor for any API changes (versions). So far, as of 2024, they updated the dataset in July 2024 – likely adding new codes for the new Gangwon special province, which shows they maintain it. We should ensure to update our reference codes (like new country or region codes) when needed.

* **Legal:** The data is released under an open license (“범용 라이선스 제한없음” = no restriction on usage). We can freely use it, including commercially. We should cite “Korea Customs Service Open Data” as the source. No personal data involved. Just be sure to use the data responsibly (e.g. not to misinform).

* **Backup:** If we need more detailed data (HS-level) than the public API provides:

  * **UN Comtrade**: It has South Korea’s data (though often at HS6 with some lag). This can fill gaps for commodity detail.
  * **KITA (Korean Intl Trade Association)**: They have a website offering trade stats with commodity detail (in English too). Possibly scraping or using their reports could yield some info (KITA publishes top 10 products, etc.).
  * **Local sources**: e.g. Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) might have trade by item. Or the monthly “Import/Export by Items” report from KCS (if any).
  * We can also consider reaching out to KCS if they have more APIs not on the open portal (some APIs might be available to approved users for detailed data).
  * In worst case, rely on partner data (like if we want SK→NL lithography machine exports, Netherlands import data might show it).

  But since semiconductors are key to Korea, they might have specific data releases on those (e.g. monthly press releases from Ministry of Trade highlight chip exports). We will incorporate such data if needed via news scraping, but from an API perspective, the above covers it.

### 2. Alternative & Commercial Trade Data Sources

Official stats are comprehensive but have limitations in **timeliness** and **granularity**. For more real-time and detailed (transaction-level) information – especially to catch early signals of changes – we turn to commercial data providers and alternative sources. These can provide **bill of lading data, shipment tracking, and supply chain details** beyond what customs reports show.

#### Panjiva (S\&P Global Market Intelligence)

* **What it is:** **Panjiva** is a global trade data platform now owned by S\&P Global. It aggregates **bill of lading records**, customs shipment data, and uses machine learning to link shipments to companies. It’s essentially a rich database of **transaction-level import/export records** from dozens of countries. This includes shipping manifests for U.S. imports (with detailed 10-digit HS codes, quantities, consignees, etc.), as well as similar data from Latin America, parts of Asia, and others. For our project, Panjiva could provide **near-real-time insight** into shipments of semiconductor-related goods – for example, if ASML ships an EUV machine from the Netherlands to Taiwan, Panjiva would capture the bill of lading (which would show up potentially within days after departure). Similarly, HBM memory modules shipped from Korea to the U.S. could be tracked by container manifests.
* **Data & Coverage:** Over **2 billion shipment records from 21 countries**. Key countries include US (import/export manifests), China (some export data via manifests to U.S.), India, Mexico, Brazil, EU (some ports data), etc. It covers about 13 million company linkages – meaning it identifies the shipper and receiver companies and links them to parent entities. For product detail, Panjiva provides the **full HS code as available in each record** (e.g. U.S. 10-digit HTS on bills, or 8/10 digit for India, etc.), and even the product description text from the manifest. This is **finer than HS6**, giving us HS-10 granularity or even textual descriptions.
* **Timeliness:** Very fast for certain routes. **U.S. import data updates daily** (as shipments clear customs, usually within a few days of arrival). Non-U.S. data varies – e.g. Mexico and India data often updated weekly or monthly, but still more frequently than official statistics releases. **Real-time monitoring (<12h)** is partly possible with Panjiva: for instance, U.S. Customs releases incoming shipment data daily (except Sundays). So within 24 hours, one can see yesterday’s arrivals. For other countries, some have slight delays. But Panjiva is certainly faster than waiting for monthly totals. This addresses our need for early warning signals – e.g., a surge in exports of a certain HS code can be detected mid-month by counting bills of lading, rather than waiting for month-end official reports.
* **API & Integration:** Panjiva offers an **API for subscribers**. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and provides endpoints to query data such as shipments, companies, etc. Based on S\&P documentation: one can query by criteria (e.g., all shipments where HS code = 854232, origin = Korea, date > 2025-07-01). The API returns JSON with shipment details. For example, a shipment record includes fields like date, origin/destination country, HS code, quantity, weight, shipper name, consignee name, port of lading, etc. They likely also allow aggregate queries (counts of shipments, sums of value if available). Panjiva’s API might not be unlimited – heavy queries may need to be broken down or use their bulk data feeds. But for our focused use (specific products and corridors), it should be fine. We might, for instance, poll daily for any new shipments in HS 854232 or HS 848620. Code snippet could look like:

  ```python
  import requests, datetime
  from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session

  session = OAuth2Session(client_id=PANJIVA_CLIENT_ID, token=TOKEN)
  params = {
      "filters": "hs_code:854232 AND origin_country:South Korea AND destination_country:Taiwan",
      "min_ship_date": "2025-07-01", "max_ship_date": "2025-07-31"
  }
  resp = session.get("https://api.panjiva.com/shipment_searches", params=params)
  data = resp.json()
  shipments = data['shipments']
  for sh in shipments:
      print(sh['ship_date'], sh['consignee'], sh['goods_description'])
  ```

  (This illustrates searching shipments; actual endpoint syntax may differ, but Panjiva did have a “Search API” for shipments). Integration complexity is moderate – dealing with OAuth tokens and potentially large result sets (if not careful with filters). But given we know exactly what to look for, we can keep queries efficient. Panjiva also can push data via their platform or through cloud (XpressFeed, Snowflake), but API suits our dynamic queries.
* **Authentication & Rate Limits:** As an enterprise service, **API access is only with a paid license**. The rate limits would be negotiated or fixed in contract – presumably high (they might allow thousands of queries per hour for enterprise users). If needed, S\&P might impose a cap like e.g. 10 queries/sec to avoid abuse. But practically, with the volume of data, we might retrieve things in bulk (like get all shipments for a month for a given HS code in one query if possible). They also have **bulk endpoints** or data streaming for heavy users. We will coordinate with S\&P support on how best to get the needed data within our usage rights.
* **Pricing:** **Expensive.** Panjiva is a premium product. While exact pricing is not public, it likely costs **tens of thousands of USD per year** for full access. For example, an S\&P Market Intelligence subscription including Panjiva data could be \$50k+ annually (depending on data scope, number of users, etc.). They may have a scaled offering if we only care about a subset (but usually it’s packaged). For our budget consideration, Panjiva is the **gold-standard but costly**. If budget is an issue, we might opt for ImportGenius (cheaper) for similar data. Another approach: S\&P offers Panjiva data via their Marketplace where you can buy specific datasets; possibly one can buy “monthly trade data for electronics” as a subset – but that’s speculative. Overall, if maximum insight is required and cost can be justified by value (for enterprise clients of our platform), Panjiva would be part of the stack. If not, see ImportGenius below for a cost-effective alternative.
* **Documentation:** Good, but behind login. S\&P provides API docs, and likely dedicated support staff. We saw references to a Panjiva API introduction in logistics media. Many users interface via the web UI or data feeds rather than directly the API, but API is available. There’s also a GitHub repository or two (maybe wrappers in R or Python contributed by others). In summary, we’ll have sufficient documentation once subscribed.
* **Reliability:** Very high. S\&P’s infrastructure ensures close to 24/7 uptime. Panjiva data updates are consistent. There is an implied SLA for enterprise clients (likely >99% uptime). Data reliability (accuracy) is also high – though keep in mind this is raw customs data, so errors come from mis-declared shipments or missing values at times. But Panjiva applies machine learning to clean some of it. We might see slight discrepancies between Panjiva’s aggregated numbers and official stats (due to coverage of certain shipments, etc.), but as a trend indicator it’s reliable.
* **Usage in Platform:** Panjiva’s value is in giving **detailed, real-time alerts**. For example, if an unusual spike in GPU exports from Country A is happening, we’d catch it weeks before official stats. We can build features like “Live Shipment Tracker” for key products using this data. However, we must be cautious: **legal/licensing** restrictions mean we cannot expose all raw data to our users unless allowed. Likely, we can show aggregated insights derived from Panjiva (counts, indices, graphs), but not let users download Panjiva’s raw shipment records without permission. S\&P’s terms usually restrict redistribution. We’ll ensure compliance by focusing on analysis (which is our core anyway).
* **Legal & Licensing:** Panjiva data is compiled from public records (like US customs data is public), but the compiled database is proprietary. Our license will dictate that we can use it internally and present analysis, but probably must attribute S\&P Global for any direct data points. We should include a disclaimer “Some shipment data © 2025 S\&P Global Market Intelligence (Panjiva)”. We cannot allow users to freely query Panjiva data beyond our contract (e.g., no raw data export beyond what’s allowed as fair use). We’ll structure our UI to highlight trends rather than acting as a free Panjiva proxy.
* **Backup Alternatives:** If Panjiva is not used (or if it’s temporarily inaccessible), **ImportGenius** or similar providers can fill much of this role. Also, US Customs data specifically can be sourced via other providers like **Descartes Datamyne**, **PIERS**, etc. We could even directly download US daily import data from government websites (some data is posted in machine-readable form daily by US CBP – though not as user-friendly). For other countries, alternatives exist (e.g. bills data from providers in each country). But Panjiva is one-stop. If it were unavailable, likely our only immediate backup is ImportGenius (which I discuss next).

#### ImportGenius API

* **What it is:** **ImportGenius** is a competitor to Panjiva, providing a global trade database focusing on shipment records. It covers many of the same sources: U.S. bills of lading, plus data from Latin America, parts of Asia, etc. ImportGenius is generally positioned as a more affordable solution for trade intelligence. It might not have as sophisticated company-linkage algorithms as Panjiva, but it has robust raw data access and an API. For our purposes, ImportGenius offers **HS-10 level data and near real-time updates** similarly, which can be used if Panjiva is out of reach due to cost.
* **Coverage:** ImportGenius claims to cover **the U.S. and 22 other countries** (which likely overlaps heavily with Panjiva’s 21). Countries include major Latin American nations (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, etc.), some in Asia (perhaps India, Vietnam, etc.), and others. It may have slightly different sets but generally covers global trade where data can be obtained. They have data going back to **2006 for U.S.** and varying start dates for others. The data is at **shipment level with HS codes, descriptions, etc.**
* **Timeliness:** **Very up-to-date.** For the U.S., ImportGenius updates daily (except Sunday) just like Panjiva. For other countries, weekly updates are typical. They tout having “one of the most updated datasets” – e.g. new U.S. entries every day, others every week. This ensures we can catch trends well before monthly official numbers.
* **API Access:** ImportGenius offers a **RESTful API (v2)** that allows searching their shipment records by various criteria (HS code, product keyword, company name, etc.). The API format, as shown in the documentation snippet, is:

  ```
  GET https://data.importgenius.com/v2/shipments?q={query}&access_token={token}&country={country}&type={im/ex}
  ```

  with queries structured as field+modifier+term, e.g. `hs_code contains 854232` or `shipper_name exactly Samsung` etc. You can also do date ranges, count-only queries, etc.. The results are returned in JSON (or XML if requested) and include shipment details similar to Panjiva. We saw examples like searching by product, zip code, date range. The API appears flexible and powerful.
* **Authentication & Rate Limiting:** API usage requires an **access\_token** in the URL (likely obtained by logging in and generating an API token under your account). ImportGenius advertises “unrestricted access” via API for their enterprise plans – meaning if you have the top plan, you aren’t artificially limited in number of queries. Practically, they probably expect you to pull reasonable amounts; if one needed the entire database, they’d give a data dump rather than API. For our anticipated use (targeted queries), we won’t hit limits. The API is robust enough to handle thousands of requests per day if needed.
* **Pricing:** **More affordable tiers.** ImportGenius offers tiered plans: e.g. *Starter* \~\$149/month, *Plus* \~\$199/month, *Premium* \~\$399/month (annual billing rates). The **Enterprise/Global plan** with API access and all countries is around **\$899/month (annual \~\$10.8k/year)**. The pricing page suggests that \$899/mo includes global data and API, with premium support. This is a fraction of Panjiva’s cost while offering similar data (albeit maybe less polished in analytics). For a freemium approach, ImportGenius even lets users do limited free searches on their site, but API requires at least a premium subscription. Relative to our platform’s potential costs, \$10k/year is manageable if this data significantly enhances the product.
* **Documentation:** Very clear from what we saw. They publicly provide guidance on API usage (the snippet in \[53] is from their site’s API guide). They have examples in multiple languages (the snippet shows Python, etc.). Also, since they cater to a wide range of users, their support likely helps with API onboarding. In short, implementing their API should be straightforward with the docs given.
* **Integration:** Easy to moderate. Constructing queries is straightforward (we can search by HS code, which is key for us). We will need to handle pagination if a query returns many results – e.g. if we query broad criteria like all shipments of “8542” for a whole year, that could be thousands of records. The API likely supports pagination with offset parameters or limit+offset. Alternatively, they may allow a streaming of results. We should design our integration to either cache or summarize shipments because we don’t want to be pulling millions of records repeatedly. Instead, perhaps a strategy: use the **countOnly** queries to get aggregate counts, and only fetch detailed records for recent shipments to highlight examples. Also, we might use their API to identify the top companies shipping certain goods, to enrich our analysis. Technically, using their API in Python looks like a simple GET request with proper query encoding. They show how to handle multi-word queries and special characters (they even support Chinese characters and accent marks in queries, which shows robust parsing). We just need to ensure URL encoding (e.g. space is +, etc., as per their examples).
* **Reliability:** The ImportGenius service is cloud-based and reliable. As a smaller company compared to S\&P, they may not have the same global infrastructure redundancy, but no major downtime issues are publicly noted. We should have a contingency to slow down queries if errors occur (to avoid IP blocking). But as paying customers, we’d get support if needed.
* **Utility for Platform:** Using ImportGenius, we can implement features similar to using Panjiva: **real-time trade alerts, company-level insights, granular HS10 trends**. For example, we could track “exports of HS854232 from SK to CN in the first 3 weeks of the month” via shipment counts as a leading indicator. Or identify which companies are the main exporters/importers for that code (which helps users understand supply chain dependencies). This adds a unique value beyond official stats.
* **Legal:** As with Panjiva, the data from ImportGenius is compiled from public records but is provided under a commercial license. We must ensure we don’t violate their terms. Likely we can display summarized information (graphs, trends) freely, but if we wanted to display individual shipment details (like Bill of Lading line-items), that might be restricted to internal use or require permission. We’ll clarify in contract. Typically, giving users an option to download raw shipments would be a no-go; instead, we incorporate the insights into our analyses. Attribution like “Source: ImportGenius” may be required when directly referencing their data. We’ll include such footnotes in relevant parts of our platform.
* **Backup:** If, for any reason, ImportGenius API is down (or if we ended the subscription), our fallback is Panjiva (if we have it), or other similar providers. There’s also an open data angle: for US, many shipment records can be obtained from the **US government (FOIA)** or services like **USA Trade Info** but it’s non-trivial to process. Realistically, if we commit to ImportGenius, we lean on it. If it fails, we might temporarily lose some real-time capability until it’s restored. We could mitigate by caching recent queries results so that short outages don’t affect us.

#### ITC Trade Map / Trade Atlas (Supplementary Data)

* **What & Why:** While we have comprehensive official and commercial data, it’s worth noting **ITC’s Trade Map** and other aggregated databases (like S\&P’s Global Trade Atlas, if available via Panjiva or separately). The ITC (International Trade Centre) Trade Map is essentially a user-friendly compilation of COMTRADE and national data, offering quick access to bilateral trade values. It’s not an API per se, but a resource to cross-verify or fetch data in a pinch. For example, if UN Comtrade is missing or slow for a certain query, TradeMap might have the number accessible via web. They also provide some unique indicators (e.g. market share, growth rates) pre-calculated.
* **Access:** **Trade Map** is accessed via web (trademap.org) with a free registration. There is **no official API**; attempts to automate via login scripts exist. We probably won’t integrate it directly due to lack of API. Instead, it’s an analyst’s tool. However, ITC might offer data through **APIs for subscribed users** or via their **Data Portal API** (they have something called “API for Market Analysis Tools” but information is scarce publicly). If needed, we could manually use their data to double-check our numbers.
* **Global Trade Atlas (GTA):** This is a commercial dataset by S\&P (previously IHS Markit) similar to Comtrade but sometimes with more timely national data. If Panjiva is in use, GTA is likely included or not needed, as Panjiva covers similar ground with more detail. GTA could be relevant if we wanted monthly official data for 95+ countries via one source. But since we have APIs for most key ones, GTA would be redundant and expensive.
* **Usage:** For our project, these supplementary sources don’t need deep integration. We will primarily rely on earlier sources. If a situation arises where a country’s data isn’t coming through official APIs (e.g. a country stops reporting to UN Comtrade), we could use ITC or GTA if available as a backup to fill that gap from secondary sources.

#### Shipping & Vessel Tracking APIs (Lloyd’s List Intelligence, MarineTraffic)

To monitor the **physical movement** of goods (especially relevant for equipment like lithography machines or ensuring supply chain flow), we incorporate **shipping intelligence**. These APIs let us trace where ships are, when key cargoes might arrive or if there are bottlenecks (port congestion, etc.). This adds a real-time logistics layer to our trade monitor.

* **Lloyd’s List Intelligence (LLI):** A venerable source of maritime data – they provide information on vessel movements, bills of lading (through their Seasearcher portal), and port activity. Lloyd’s likely has APIs or data feeds for vessel tracking, but typically they are enterprise solutions. For example, one might get alerts when a specific vessel (like one carrying critical semiconductor equipment) passes through a certain canal or arrives at port. For our platform, we might use LLI to get **container shipment tracking** for certain supply routes (like tracking if shipments from Rotterdam to Taipei are facing delays). LLI’s data could also provide context like if there’s a drop in the number of container ships leaving a key port, which might signal a trade slowdown. However, LLI is high-end and pricey, possibly more than our immediate budget if we already have Panjiva/ImportGenius. We might consider it if customers demand deep logistics insight. Integration would likely be custom (LLI might not have a public REST API; they might deliver data via FTP or custom services). Because of this complexity, an easier alternative for live vessel info is **MarineTraffic**.

* **MarineTraffic API:** MarineTraffic provides real-time **AIS (Automatic Identification System)** data for ships. Through their API, we can get:

  * **Live vessel positions** (latitude/longitude, speed, destination) for ships of interest.
  * **Port call history** – when a vessel arrived/departed a port.
  * **Voyage ETA** – estimated arrival times.
  * **Vessel details** – type, size, etc.

  For example, if we know a certain **EUV machine** is being shipped (often these go by air due to value, but suppose by sea for heavy equipment), we could monitor the ship carrying it. Or more broadly, monitor all container vessels departing South Korea to see if congestion arises. MarineTraffic’s API is well-documented and modular (different endpoints with credit costs).

  * **Authentication:** It uses an API key and a credit system. You buy a plan that gives X credits per day which are consumed by queries (e.g. 1 credit per position lookup). The **Basic plan \~ \$10/month** is limited (for hobbyist use), but **Business plans** ranging from \$150 to \$1,000+ per month give more data and historical access. For us, a **Standard plan \~ \$150/mo** might suffice to track key routes. They also have a Developer tier possibly.
  * **Integration:** Very straightforward REST with queries like `vessel_id=12345` or `port=Shanghai`. The response is JSON. We’d integrate it to show maps or alerts (e.g. “vessel carrying lithography equipment has arrived in Busan port”). We can embed this as an additional feature.
  * **Use Case:** Particularly helpful for **near-real-time monitoring of supply chain disruptions**. For instance, if geopolitical issues arise (a port closure, a ship stuck), our platform can alert users that “Shipments of XYZ might be delayed due to vessel incident”. This goes beyond trade stats into supply chain risk, which is a selling point to industry experts.

* **Other AIS providers:** There are also **Datalastic** (which is an AIS API provider with simpler pricing, e.g. €100 for 20k calls/month), and **Kpler** which integrates maritime data for commodities. MarineTraffic is well-known and reliable, so it’s a safe pick. If needed, we might complement with **Terrestrial data** (for example, if we want to track trucks or air cargo: there are APIs for flight tracking too like FlightAware, but probably beyond our current scope).

* **Pricing and Plans:** Summarizing:

  * Lloyd’s List: likely enterprise license > \$50k/year if full data, maybe not justified for us initially.
  * MarineTraffic: a **Standard API plan** might be a few hundred USD per month. G2 reviews mention a Standard edition around £16.50 (maybe a personal plan) and higher tiers for enterprise. We’ll assume \~\$2000/year for a good API package.
  * We should weigh if this cost yields value for our users. Possibly as a premium feature or for specific alerts (maybe relevant to container shortages or shipping time metrics).

* **Integration & Reliability:** MarineTraffic’s API has been around for years and is stable. We just need to be mindful of not exhausting our credits. We can code safeguards (e.g. call positions API for a vessel at a reasonable frequency, not every minute unless needed). Data quality: AIS data can have gaps (if a ship turns off transponder or is out of range for a bit). But for big picture trends, it’s fine.

* **Legal:** Using AIS data via MarineTraffic is allowed under their terms with subscription. We have to ensure we don’t redistribute raw AIS data to third parties beyond what’s permitted (likely we can display it on our platform but not give others the raw feed). Attribution to MarineTraffic when showing vessel on a map is usually required (like their logo on maps if using their tiles).

* **Backup:** If MarineTraffic has issues, alternatives: **VesselFinder** (similar service), **FleetMon** etc. Many exist. We could swap providers if needed relatively easily as long as we know the vessel IDs we care about.

### 3. Economic & Financial Context Data APIs

Trade flows are influenced by macroeconomic conditions. To give users context (like currency fluctuations, economic growth, or trade balances), and to build composite indicators (e.g. “semiconductor exports as % of GDP”), we include **economic data APIs** from central banks and international organizations.

#### FRED API (Federal Reserve Economic Data)

* **Scope:** **FRED** offers 816,000+ time series covering U.S. and international economic indicators. For our needs, relevant series include:

  * **Trade balances and indexes**: e.g. *US Imports from South Korea (IMPKR)*, *US Export Price Index for Semiconductors*, etc.
  * **Industrial production indices** for electronics.
  * **Exchange rates** (USD/KRW, USD/TWD) – important because currency changes affect trade competitiveness.
  * **Interest rates, inflation** – broader context for analysts.

  Also, FRED often aggregates data from sources like BEA, Census, World Bank into convenient series.
* **Authentication & Usage:** FRED’s API is open but requires a free **API key (app\_id)**. It’s easy to obtain from the St. Louis Fed website. The usage is straightforward: `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=IMPKR&api_key=YOURKEY&file_type=json`. This would get monthly US imports from South Korea in JSON. FRED’s API includes endpoints to search series, get category listings, etc.
* **Rate Limits:** According to their support, **120 requests per minute** is the limit. That’s plenty for our usage. There’s also a daily limit around 100k if I recall, but that’s rarely hit. Our platform likely will cache this data or update it daily/weekly, so minimal calls.
* **Update Frequency:** Varies by series. Many U.S. monthly series (like trade data) update within hours of the official release (for instance, when Census releases monthly trade, FRED might update the series the same day or next). Some international series update annually. For critical ones:

  * *IMPKR (US Imports from KR)* updates monthly, a few days after Census (since BEA releases those in trade reports).
  * *World semiconductor sales* (if present in FRED via SIA) updates monthly.
  * We might use *daily* series like exchange rates which update every business day.

  So freshness is good (usually same-day or with one day lag).
* **Integration:** Very simple, just form URLs and parse JSON or CSV. Many libraries (`fredapi` in Python) simplify it further, but raw REST is fine. We can easily embed code to fetch certain series and plot them on our platform. Example:

  ```python
  import requests
  url = ("https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?"
         "series_id=TWNGDPNQDSMEI&api_key=MYKEY&file_type=json")
  data = requests.get(url).json()
  latest_gdp = data['observations'][-1]['value']
  ```

  This might retrieve Taiwan’s GDP (if that series exists in FRED).
* **Cost:** **Free.** No charge for usage. This is extremely cost-effective for us to include macro data.
* **Reliability:** Top-notch. The St. Louis Fed’s API has very high uptime and is designed to support heavy traffic from academic and financial users. We don’t need to worry about downtime. The data quality is directly from official sources, curated by economists.
* **Use Case in Platform:** We will use FRED to provide charts like *“U.S. Tech Imports vs. USD Index”*, *“Semiconductor Equipment Exports vs. South Korea Export Volume Index”*, etc. Also, to contextualize trade data: e.g., if Taiwan’s exports dip, show GDP or export orders index to see if it correlates. FRED allows one to pull other countries’ data if included (FRED includes a lot of OECD, World Bank data for many countries). For more specialized indicators not in FRED, we go to World Bank or IMF.
* **Legal:** Data via FRED is typically public domain or attributed to sources. The Fed’s terms of use allow broad use; they request acknowledging the St. Louis Fed FRED service. We should list “Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)” for any charts we produce with their data. No other restrictions.
* **Backup:** If FRED is not available (rare), we can directly retrieve from original source (e.g. BEA or Census for U.S. series, or World Bank API for global ones). But using FRED simplifies things as one source. We’ll likely cache FRED data in our database anyway to reduce calls.

#### World Bank API (World Development Indicators & others)

* **Scope:** The **World Bank’s APIs** provide a wealth of global data, including the **World Development Indicators (WDI)**, which cover macroeconomic and trade indicators for virtually all countries. Key data for us:

  * GDP, GDP per capita, etc.
  * Trade as % of GDP, current account balance, etc.
  * Specific indicators like *High-technology exports (current US\$)*, *Research & development expenditure % GDP*, which might be interesting context for tech trade.
  * Also **World Bank’s WITS (World Integrated Trade Solution)** provides trade data (similar to Comtrade) accessible via an API, including tariffs and bilateral trade by HS at annual level.
* **Authentication & Limits:** For most World Bank data API (v2), **no API key is required** for reasonable use. They mention you can register for a key which primarily is to get higher rate limits. Without a key, you get around **100K queries per day** which is far above what we’d do. With a key, perhaps up to 1 million/day. But in any case, we won’t hit those. The API endpoints are simple REST: `http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/{countryCode}/indicator/{indicatorCode}?date=YYYY`. It can return JSON or XML by specifying format. By default, the results are paged (max 100 observations per page), so sometimes you have to handle pagination for long time series.
* **Update Frequency:** Annual indicators (like GDP) update annually (with a lag of a few months after year-end). Some indicators are quarterly or monthly (World Bank has some high-frequency data, but not much in WDI). They also have **monthly trade data for some countries** via WITS, but that often comes from UN Comtrade. For contextual economic data, the frequencies are fine (e.g. GDP annually is enough). For things like exchange rates or PMI indices, we might use other sources like FRED or TradingEconomics if needed; the WB API is mostly development indicators.
* **Integration:** Very easy. Example:

  ```
  GET https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/KOR/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?date=2010:2020&format=json
  ```

  gives Korea’s exports of goods & services (% of GDP) for 2010-2020 in JSON. The response structure has two elements: \[0] metadata (paging info), \[1] data array. We parse the \[1] list. If no data, it may return an empty array.
  There are also endpoints to get country metadata, list of indicators, etc. We likely will hardcode the indicator codes we need (found from their indicator catalog).
* **Cost:** **Free**. The World Bank encourages use of their data.
* **Reliability:** High. It’s a longstanding API with global use. It might be slightly slower than FRED but overall reliable. No major downtime issues known. If we request large data without specifying date filter, we might get a big payload, but normally it’s fine.
* **Use Case:** Provide global context charts. E.g. *“South Korea High-Tech Exports (WB definition) vs. Total Exports”*, *“R\&D spending of key countries”*, *“Ease of Doing Business rank”* etc. Perhaps not core to semiconductor trade flows but helpful for reports or deep-dives. We can also use WDI for partner countries that aren’t covered in detail but we want to note something (e.g. population or GDP of a small partner country).
* **Legal:** World Bank data is mostly **open data (CC BY 4.0)**. Attribution: “Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators” or similar in our methodology notes. There’s no limitation on commercial use as long as we attribute and don’t claim WB endorses us.
* **Backup:** If needed, many of these indicators are also available via FRED (World Bank WDI series are imported into FRED for many countries) or via other sources like IMF. But the WB API is comprehensive enough that we can stick to it for development stats.

#### IMF Data API (e.g. IMF IFS, BOP, DOTS)

* **Scope:** The **IMF** provides data through its APIs including:

  * **International Financial Statistics (IFS)** – key economic indicators for countries (some overlapping WDI).
  * **Balance of Payments (BOP)** – detailed current account, exports/imports of goods and services, etc.
  * **Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS)** – which is IMF’s dataset of bilateral trade flows (monthly, quarterly, annual). DOTS is basically similar to Comtrade but sometimes has estimates for missing data.
  * The IMF also has specialized datasets like *Financial Soundness Indicators*, but less relevant to trade.
* **Authentication & Access:** The IMF has a unified data portal (IMF SDMX API). For most data, **no key** is required for up to a certain volume. They do have API registration for intensive use, but we likely won’t exceed limits. The base endpoint is like `https://datasd.imf.org/SDMXJSON.svc/` with dataset codes (e.g. `IFS` or `DOT`) and parameters. It can return JSON or SDMX-ML. Many developers use JSON since 2021 when IMF introduced that option.
* **Rate Limits:** In documentation, they mention something akin to **50,000 observations per query** limit (which is like Comtrade). If you request more, you need to split or use an iterative approach. They also might limit to maybe 10 queries per second to protect servers. Since we’ll be grabbing relatively small slices (e.g. one country’s BOP series), this is fine.
* **Update Frequency:**

  * **DOTS**: monthly data, updated monthly (with 1-2 month lag, e.g. Jan data in Mar). Could be useful if some bilateral data missing from Comtrade or for cross-check.
  * **BOP/IIP**: quarterly mostly, updated quarterly. E.g. current account balance % GDP, etc.
  * These are not real-time but they give an official angle on trade in services, etc., which might complement goods trade.
  * Possibly useful: IMF’s high-frequency trade index (they created some during COVID, but not sure if publicly in API).
* **Integration:** A bit technical due to SDMX. For example:

  ```
  GET https://datasd.imf.org/SDMXJSON.svc/CompactData/DOT.M.TWN.EXP?startPeriod=2020
  ```

  might get Taiwan exports (EXP) from DOTS dataset monthly. The response JSON is nested with series and observations. We may need to parse out values. Using an SDMX library or just processing JSON by key. It’s doable but less straightforward than say FRED/WB. We might decide how much IMF data is really needed vs what we can get from simpler sources.
* **Cost:** **Free**. IMF data is free to use with citation.
* **Reliability:** Good, though occasionally the IMF API can be slow for large requests. If we stick to smaller ones, fine. The main site sometimes has downtime during maintenance (rare). Overall it’s fine for embedding in our backend processes (not user-facing live calls, we probably pre-fetch what we need).
* **Use Case:** If we want to show, for example, *“Taiwan Current Account Balance”* or *“Export of Services from Korea”* etc., IMF data would provide that (World Bank might not have detailed quarterly BOP). DOTS might be used to quickly get an aggregate of “global semiconductor exports” if we sum certain countries (but that might be easier done with Comtrade data we already have). It's optional, nice to have for completeness in analysis. If we find our platform’s audience likes macro-financial context, IMF data is useful (especially for currency reserves, etc., not directly trade but relevant to supply chain stability).
* **Legal:** Data is free; just attribute “Source: IMF DOTS” or similar when used. No distribution restrictions for aggregated indicators.
* **Backup:** Most IMF data cross-posts to other places (e.g. IFS also available in FRED for large countries). If IMF API fails, we can skip or wait it out. Not mission-critical for core trade flows.

### 4. Geopolitical & News Event APIs

Trade flows, especially for semiconductors, are highly sensitive to policy changes, geopolitical tensions, and industry news (export controls, sanctions, supply chain disruptions, etc.). To capture these qualitative factors, we incorporate APIs that track news and events:

#### GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) API

* **What it is:** **GDELT** monitors worldwide news media in multiple languages and uses algorithms to code events (protests, treaties, policy announcements, etc.) with parameters like actors, themes, location, tone. It’s like a firehose of geopolitical and news events updated in near real-time. For our needs, GDELT can flag things like “Country X announced new export restrictions on chips” or “Factory Y fire disrupted chip supply” in the news, which we can surface as alerts or context.

* **Data & Coverage:** GDELT 2.0’s Event Database has global coverage, updated every **15 minutes** with events from print, broadcast, web news. It also has a **Global Knowledge Graph (GKG)** that tracks themes and entities in news. For example, theme tags like `TECH.Semiconductors` or `EXPORT_CONTROLS` might be applied to relevant articles. GDELT covers news back to 1979 (for historical) and is continuous to present.

* **Access & API:** GDELT has several access methods:

  * The **GDELT Event API**: you can query recent events by keywords, location, etc. For example, hitting a URL like `https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/events/query?query=semiconductor%20export%20controls&mode=ArtList&maxrecords=50&format=json` would return a list of news articles (with metadata like URL, title, date) matching that query in recent GDELT data.
  * The **GeoJSON/Geo API** for mapping events.
  * The **GKG API** for theme queries.

  GDELT also dumps data files every 15 minutes which can be ingested, but using their query API is simpler for targeted queries.

  No API key is required; it’s open. We just have to use the syntax correctly and not overload with huge queries.

* **Rate Limit:** There’s no formal published limit, but practically the queries shouldn’t be too heavy. The GDELT Project is academic; they allow broad use but if we were to, say, download millions of records regularly, they might throttle or ask to use BigQuery. For our platform, we’ll likely issue focused queries on specific topics or for specific time windows, which is fine. We might do a query every hour or so to check if any new events related to our themes popped up, which is negligible load.

* **Update Frequency:** **Every 15 minutes** new data is available. That’s effectively near-real-time. We can poll periodically or even use the GDELT “flow” (they have a real-time update file listing eventIDs added in last 15 min). This satisfies <12h requirement for event detection easily.

* **Integration:** Using the API is simple – just an HTTP GET with query parameters. The JSON returned includes the list of matching articles/events. For example, a result might contain fields like `url`, `title`, `seendate`, `socialImage` etc (if using the ArtList mode). If we use the raw event mode, we get event codes and actor info. But for readability, likely we’ll use the article list mode to get news headlines relevant to our topics. We might filter by known keywords (semiconductor, chip, ASML, HBM, export ban, etc.). We can also filter by location if needed (e.g. events in “Taiwan” or involving “US-China”). It might take some tuning to avoid too many irrelevant results, but GDELT has extensive filtering capabilities (by theme, source country, etc.).
  We will embed relevant news headlines on our dashboard (e.g. a ticker “News: US considering new GPU export restrictions – Source: Reuters, 2025-07-22”). To ensure reliability, maybe cross-check the source (some GDELT sources can be obscure, but many are mainstream). Possibly we refine to only include known credible sources via GDELT’s source filter.

* **Cost:** **Free.** GDELT is funded by grants and cloud support (Google). We pay nothing to use it (except maybe Google BigQuery cost if we went that route, but we won’t need to for small queries).

* **Reliability:** GDELT is quite stable, though if our server relies on it for important alerts, we should consider caching results in case GDELT’s API is slow or briefly down. They operate on Google Cloud and have historically been consistent. The data quality: because it’s fully automated, there will be noise (some irrelevant articles might slip through, or some minor local news might appear). But as a broad early-warning system, it’s invaluable. It can also capture foreign language news that we’d otherwise miss.

* **Use Case:** Examples:

  * If a new **export control** regulation is announced, GDELT will capture it often within minutes of news agencies posting it. We can then alert users “Policy Alert: Japan tightens export of chip materials (link to news)”.
  * If there’s a **disaster** (factory fire, earthquake, etc.) affecting semiconductor supply chain, we’ll see it via news mention.
  * If there’s **geopolitical tension** (war risk, etc.) in a region with key fabs, we can highlight that.

  We could even integrate GDELT’s sentiment score (how positively or negatively semiconductors are being discussed) as a contextual indicator.

* **Legal:** GDELT is open data. However, the content it references (news articles) are copyrighted by their publishers. GDELT gives URLs and brief snippets. We should display only snippet or title plus link, which is fair use (similar to what Google News does). That should be legally fine. Perhaps avoid storing full articles. As for citing GDELT, not strictly needed, but we can say “(via GDELT)” in fine print if desired. Typically, one would cite the news source itself (e.g., “Reuters” as the source of the article).

* **Backup:** If GDELT were to shut down (unlikely in short term), alternatives:

  * **Google News API** (was discontinued, but there are third-party wrappers or “NewsAPI” services which aggregate news, often for a fee but some free tier).
  * **Event Registry** or **AYLIEN News API** – commercial news APIs with sophisticated filtering (but expensive).
  * We could manually set up alerts from major news sites (RSS feeds from Reuters, etc. or use their APIs if accessible). But GDELT’s breadth is unique. So we’ll lean on it. Possibly supplement by specifically tracking some feeds (e.g. subscribe to the EU Official Journal for any trade regulation).

#### News APIs (Reuters, Bloomberg, etc.)

* **Reuters News API:** Reuters (Thomson Reuters/Refinitiv) offers a feed of news articles and possibly a developer API for headlines. Given our users (financial analysts), they likely have access to news terminals. But integrating raw news data could add value by directly linking relevant news.

  * **Access:** Typically via **Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP) APIs** or the older Reuters News Feed (RDF). They are **paid services**. For example, Reuters might allow you to query latest headlines by topic, or you can subscribe to a feed of news tagged with certain industries. To use it, one likely needs to license the news feed. For a startup platform, that cost might be significant – Reuters might charge based on number of users or distribution. Possibly not feasible unless we partner or use a limited amount (like just some headlines or requiring the user to have a subscription).
  * **Bloomberg API:** Bloomberg Terminal has an API (the Bloomberg Desktop API) which allows a user to programmatically retrieve data (market data, news headlines, etc.), but it requires the user to have a Terminal session running. We can’t integrate that in a SaaS offering to all users (each user would need Bloomberg which is \$2k/mo each). There is also **Bloomberg Enterprise** solutions (B-PIPE, etc.) but extremely costly. So probably not directly.
  * **Other**: There’s also **Dow Jones/Factiva** or **LexisNexis** for news, similarly expensive.

* **Strategy:** Instead of directly piping Reuters or Bloomberg, we can rely on **GDELT plus possibly RSS feeds**:

  * Reuters publishes some RSS feeds publicly (like Top News, or maybe technology news). We could ingest those RSS for free content (which includes headline and a short lead).
  * Bloomberg’s free site has some news which we could monitor via RSS or scraping (but a lot is paywalled).
  * Alternatively, **Google News RSS** for specific keywords might be used. For example, Google News can generate RSS for a search query. This is unofficial but widely used. That could complement GDELT by focusing on top stories in major outlets.

* **Use in platform:** We may not have to integrate heavy news APIs if GDELT covers it. But if clients expect specifically “Bloomberg Terminal says X”, we might incorporate a field in our interface for users to input their Bloomberg API credentials if they have (that’s advanced and out-of-scope for now).

* **Licensing:** If we did integrate Reuters directly, we’d be under a contract that defines how we can display it (likely limited excerpts). For now, we will avoid that complexity and use open sources.

**Conclusion on News:** We will rely on **GDELT (primary)** and possibly supplement with **RSS feeds** from major news (free content only) to ensure we catch critical trade-related news. This gives us a broad and cost-effective coverage without entering into pricey content licensing at launch. If later we partner with a news provider for richer content, we can re-evaluate.

### 5. Authentication & Infrastructure APIs

Running a production web application with user accounts, subscription payments, and notifications requires integrating various supporting services. These are largely “under the hood” but essential for security, user management, and operations.

#### User Authentication & Authorization (OAuth) – Auth0, Firebase Auth, AWS Cognito

To manage **user logins, sign-ups, and API keys for our service**, we can use an Identity-as-a-Service platform rather than building from scratch:

* **Auth0:** A popular authentication service that supports **username/password, social logins, multi-factor auth, and issuing JWT tokens** for API calls. Using Auth0, we can easily implement a secure login dialog, handle password resets, etc., and define user roles (e.g. free vs paid user). Auth0 also has **Rules/Actions** that can be used to attach metadata (like what subscription tier a user has, to enforce API call limits).

  * **API Key Management:** Auth0 can issue JWTs for our own API. Alternatively, we might need to manage separate API keys if we allow users to use an API of our platform. Auth0 does have hooks for Machine-to-Machine tokens, or we could generate static API keys stored in user metadata.
  * **Integration:** Auth0 provides SDKs for frontend (so users can log in via Universal Login page) and for backend (middleware to validate tokens). This saves time and ensures robust security (they handle password storage, etc.).
  * **Cost:** Auth0 has a **free tier** for up to \~7,000 active users, then paid (around \$23/month for 1k users on the “Essentials” plan, scaling upwards). Given we might have a niche user base initially, we could fit in free or low-tier. If we eventually have thousands of users, the cost will go up but presumably revenue does too.
  * Auth0’s high-tier enterprise features (SAML integration, etc.) would matter if selling to large companies, but to start, the developer tier suffices.
* **Firebase Authentication:** Part of Google’s Firebase, it similarly offers password and social logins, plus easy integration especially if our front-end is JavaScript. It has a generous **free tier** (unlimited daily logins, just \$0.01 per 1000 verifications after the first 10k). It’s very developer-friendly and can integrate with Firebase’s other services. It doesn’t natively create API keys for users, but we can use Firebase’s custom claims to mark user tiers. We’d likely issue Firebase JWTs (which we’d verify on server using Firebase SDK).

  * A consideration: if we plan to also have a mobile app, Firebase Auth integrates well. Also, if using Firebase Firestore/DB, it can unify auth with data security rules. However, for just auth alone, Auth0 vs Firebase is basically a toss depending on preference.
* **AWS Cognito:** Amazon’s solution for user pools and federated identity. Good if our stack is on AWS, and it’s fairly cheap (50k MAUs free, then \~\$0.005 per user beyond). It allows hosted UI or custom UI, and issues JWT tokens. It can integrate with API Gateway to do request-level auth easily. Cognito is powerful but has a steeper learning curve and somewhat less polish in documentation. If we foresee deep AWS integration (like using API Gateway for rate limiting by user tier, which Cognito tokens can help with), it’s a candidate.

**Our likely choice:** **Auth0**, given its ease and robust API key features, unless we prefer to avoid an extra vendor and use Cognito since it’s included in AWS. But to minimize dev time, Auth0 is great.

* **User Management Capabilities:** All these solutions handle:

  * Account creation (with email verification).
  * Password resets.
  * Multi-factor auth (Auth0 and Firebase easily allow adding MFA).
  * Linking social accounts (e.g. log in with Google/LinkedIn – useful for an analyst platform).
  * Role-based access control (Auth0’s RBAC feature or custom claims).
  * We can store profile info (name, organization) in the auth database or link to our own database.

* **API Key Management:** We have a “freemium model”, possibly allowing users to make API calls (if we expose an API for our data). We’d need to manage API tokens:

  * One method: Use the same JWT that a user gets on login for web, but that is short-lived and interactive.
  * Better: Issue a long-lived API key/secret for each user for them to use programmatically. Auth0 doesn’t by default give static API keys per user (it focuses on JWT and client credentials flows). We may implement our own API key issuance: e.g. generate a random key and store it in Auth0 metadata or our DB, and require that key in API calls (like how OpenAI API key works).
  * Alternatively, require users to use OAuth client credentials (Auth0 can treat our API as a resource and let a user generate a personal token via a client credentials flow – somewhat advanced).

  Given time, simplest: generate a random token string for each user on sign-up (store hashed in our DB) and use that as their API key. This is separate from Auth0 but can coexist.

* **Infrastructure Integration:** These Auth services are cloud-hosted (Auth0 is cloud, Firebase is Google cloud). We will integrate via their SDKs or REST. They all have high availability.

* **Security:** They all follow OAuth2 standards and best practices, which is better than rolling our own. They also manage things like password hashing, breach detection (Auth0 has anomaly detection that can alert if a brute force is happening).

* **Cost:** Outlined above – likely free or minimal cost until user count grows large. It’s a necessary expense for security and user convenience.

#### Payment Processing – Stripe API

To monetize through a **subscription model (freemium to premium)**, we need a robust payment solution. **Stripe** is the go-to for SaaS subscriptions.

* **Capabilities:** Stripe allows us to create **Products and Pricing Plans** (e.g. “Basic (free)”, “Pro \$X/month”, “Enterprise custom”). It handles:

  * Credit card charges (and other methods like ACH, Apple Pay, etc. as needed).
  * Recurring billing – automatically charging users monthly or yearly.
  * Trials, proration, upgrades/downgrades.
  * Webhooks to notify us of events (successful payment, failed payment, subscription canceled, etc.).
  * We can also implement coupon codes or usage-based billing if needed (not likely initially).

* **Integration:** Stripe has both **RESTful API** and high-level libraries in many languages. For our use:

  * We will probably use **Stripe Checkout or Stripe customer portal** for simplicity: That way, Stripe handles the entire credit card input securely (so we don’t deal with PCI compliance) and then returns a session result.
  * Alternatively, we embed Stripe Elements for a custom payment form.
  * We’ll use the Stripe API to create customers when they subscribe, attach a payment method, and subscribe them to a Plan ID.
  * We need to listen to webhooks (via an endpoint on our server) for events like `invoice.payment_failed` (to possibly downgrade the user or email them) or `customer.subscription.deleted`.

  Example pseudo-code (Python using Stripe’s library):

  ```python
  import stripe
  stripe.api_key = "sk_test_..."  # secret key
  # create checkout session for a new subscription
  session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
      customer_email=user.email,
      payment_method_types=["card"],
      subscription_data={"items": [{"price": "price_pro_plan_id"}]},
      success_url="https://ourapp/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
      cancel_url="https://ourapp/cancel"
  )
  return session.url  # redirect user to this URL
  ```

  This yields a hosted payment page.

  After success, Stripe will call our webhook with `checkout.session.completed` and we confirm activation.

* **Rate Limits:** Stripe’s API is quite scalable. There are rate limits (like 100 read ops per second, 100 write ops per second in their documentation) – far beyond what we’d do. Payments are event-driven, not high volume transactions (except on scale of millions of users, which would be a good problem).

* **Cost:** Stripe charges **2.9% + \$0.30** per transaction (typical for credit cards). There’s no monthly fee for basic features. Some specific features (like Stripe Tax or advanced fraud protection) might add small fees. For our budgeting, roughly \~3% of revenue goes to Stripe. That is acceptable and likely better than trying to negotiate with banks directly. If we later have significant volume or prefer lower fees, we could consider ACH (0.8% capped at \$5) or wire transfers for enterprise, but card is easiest early on.

* **Freemium handling:** We can use Stripe to manage free vs paid:

  * Free users can be represented either as a Stripe customer with a \$0 plan (Stripe supports free plans or one could simply not create a Stripe record until they pay).
  * Alternatively, track free-tier in our app only. But using Stripe for free might clutter data. Possibly we create Stripe customers only when they upgrade.

* **Subscription Management:** Stripe provides a **billing portal** we can integrate so users can update card, cancel subscription themselves – nice to reduce our overhead. It’s a pre-built page we can enable.

* **Notifications:** We might integrate Stripe webhooks with our email system to send welcome emails, payment receipts (though Stripe can send receipts itself).

* **Legal/Compliance:** Stripe handles PCI compliance for us since we won't touch raw card data. We should have terms of service that mention recurring billing, etc., but Stripe provides some legal boilerplate for checkout as well.

* **Alternatives:** PayPal could be added for those who prefer it, but Stripe is often enough. Other systems like Braintree (also PayPal) or Adyen are more complex. Starting with Stripe is simplest, expanding payment options as needed later.

#### Notification APIs – Email (SendGrid/Mailgun) and SMS (Twilio)

To keep users informed (especially for alerts and reports), we’ll utilize communication APIs:

* **SendGrid (Twilio SendGrid) or Mailgun:** For sending emails (e.g. account verification, password reset, weekly summary reports, alert notifications like “New data available for June!”).

  * Both have similar offerings. SendGrid has a free tier (100 emails/day) which might suffice early on. Mailgun’s free tier is 5,000 emails/month for 3 months then 1,000/month free.
  * We might lean on SendGrid since Twilio (which owns SendGrid) could be convenient if we also use Twilio SMS. Also Auth0 integrates easily with SendGrid for email verification templates.
  * Integration: Use their SMTP relay or API. API is JSON HTTP – e.g. send a POST to sendgrid with JSON of `to, from, subject, content`. With Mailgun, you can do HTTP or just use SMTP with credentials. Both handle the heavy lifting of deliverability (DKIM, etc.). We’ll need to verify our sending domain and set up SPF/DKIM records.
  * Use Cases:

    * **Transactional emails**: signup confirmation, password reset (though Auth0/Firebase can handle these with their built-in email service if configured – but often they require you to provide an SMTP).
    * **Alert emails**: if user subscribes to alerts like “notify me when Taiwan’s export data is updated or when an event triggers”.
    * **Newsletter / Reports**: possibly a monthly report email with key stats.
  * Rate limit: The free tier is small (100/day), but the next paid tier (\~\$15/mo) gives e.g. 40k emails/month. That’s plenty for a moderate user base (if we have 1000 users and send a few emails each per month, still fine).
  * We should also incorporate an unsubscribe mechanism for any non-transactional emails to comply with CAN-SPAM, which SendGrid can help manage.

* **Twilio SMS/WhatsApp:** Twilio’s core is SMS and voice. We can use SMS for critical alerts or 2FA:

  * Example: If a user wants SMS alert for “urgent trade news” or when new data crosses a threshold, we could send an SMS. Or a daily summary SMS if they prefer.
  * Also, we could integrate WhatsApp through Twilio if international users prefer that for alerts.
  * Costs: Twilio SMS in US \~\$0.0079 per message, similar cost in other countries (some more, some less). We’d probably not send a large volume of SMS, only for high-value alerts or if user sets it up (since we may charge premium users for SMS alerts due to cost). If 100 alerts SMS go out in a month, that’s less than \$1.
  * Integration: Twilio’s API uses basic auth with Account SID and Auth Token, and you POST to their message endpoint with `to`, `from`, and text. Twilio also can manage reply handling if needed (probably not needed for us).
  * If we use Twilio for SMS, we might also use it for phone verification or multi-factor for logins if we want (Auth0 integrates with Twilio for SMS MFA).

* **Webhook Notifications:** We also consider allowing **webhooks for users** – e.g. a user wants our system to POST data to their URL when an event occurs (rather than email). That’s an advanced feature. We might not implement at launch, but designing the system with that in mind (like internal events bus where we can plug in a webhook sender) is wise. If we do support it, we’d just implement it ourselves (no external API needed, just securely storing user’s webhook URL and making posts). There are also services like **Zapier** which we could integrate with to let users connect our alerts to various apps, but that might not be needed initially if we provide standard channels (email, SMS, maybe Slack integration via webhook could be a nice touch).

* **Monitoring Notifications:** For internal ops, if our system has errors, we might use a service like Sentry (discussed below) that can alert devs by email or Slack. This is separate from user notifications but part of our own monitoring stack.

**In summary,** we’ll incorporate **SendGrid** for email and **Twilio** for SMS as needed. Both have straightforward APIs and a usage-based cost structure that scales with us. They offload the complexity of dealing with telecomm and email servers.

### 6. Deployment, Hosting, and Monitoring Infrastructure

Finally, to **deploy** our application and ensure it’s running smoothly, we integrate with cloud platform APIs and monitoring tools:

#### Cloud Hosting – Fly.io, Railway, AWS/GCP

Our platform needs to be deployed on reliable infrastructure, including the application backend, frontend, and databases. We have multiple options:

* **Fly.io:** A modern PaaS that lets you deploy Docker containers to a global edge network. Advantages:

  * Easy to deploy via CLI, with free allowances for small VMs.
  * Good for low-latency global delivery (we could run instances in regions near our users to speed up the web app, though our app might not need that).
  * Built-in support for Postgres clusters (Fly has a Volumes feature for stateful services).
  * For a lean team, Fly.io’s simplicity (just provide a Dockerfile or use their builder) is attractive.
  * API: Fly does have an API to manage apps, though we mostly use their CLI. If needed, we could automate scaling or deployment via their API in CI/CD.
  * Cost: after free tier, it’s usage-based (their smallest VM is free for some, then like \$0.02/hour beyond free). We could probably run the initial app nearly free. Later, maybe \$50-100/month for more capacity.
* **Railway:** Similar to Fly, easy deployment of apps and databases. It has a nice UI and auto deploy from GitHub.

  * Good for prototyping, but their free tier is limited by hours or \$5 credit. It might run out if app is always-on (720 hours).
  * But pricing is still manageable.
  * Railway doesn't have global edge like Fly, but uses AWS under the hood typically.
  * Could use it for hosting the backend API and maybe DB.
* **AWS/GCP:** If we need more enterprise-scale or want specific managed services:

  * We could run on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS** with relatively low overhead or use **AWS Amplify** if front-end heavy.
  * Use **RDS** for managed Postgres (though cost \~ \$50+/mo for decent instance).
  * Benefit: easy to integrate Cognito if using that, and plenty of other services (S3 for file storage, etc.).
  * GCP similarly with App Engine or Cloud Run (Cloud Run could be a nice option to deploy containers serverless-ly).
  * However, these can be overkill and cost more at small scale (Amplify free tier could handle some, but e.g. Cloud Run costs might add up with constant use).

**Plan:** Possibly use **Fly.io** for the live deployment because of its simplicity and global reach. If needed, use AWS for certain components (like large data storage on S3). Railway is also a good candidate for quick DB and service hosting. We might even mix: e.g. host DB on Railway (they have one-click Postgres) and host app on Fly. But consolidating might be easier.

* **Data Storage:** We need to store data from APIs (to avoid hitting external APIs repeatedly and to allow our own fast queries). Options:

  * A **PostgreSQL** database for structured data (trade records, user data, etc.). We can either self-host Postgres on Fly/Railway or use a managed instance (Railway provides up to 1GB on free tier, which might suffice at first; Fly requires running our own Postgres instance but they have guides).
  * **Cloud storage (AWS S3 or GCP Cloud Storage)** for any large files or backups, perhaps for storing bulk CSVs from Comtrade/Eurostat that we download. We might integrate AWS S3 via its API to store those. AWS S3 API is well-known and any cloud can talk to it (we could also consider using something like Backblaze B2 or Cloudflare R2 for cost savings but AWS S3 is standard).
  * If using AWS for storage, we’d use AWS’s Python SDK (boto3) or direct REST for uploading objects.
* **Scaling & Infrastructure APIs:** If usage grows, we may use:

  * **Kubernetes** (maybe on GCP’s autopilot or AWS EKS) if needed for complex scaling – but likely overkill initially.
  * The PaaS like Fly can scale horizontally by simply increasing instance count via CLI or their API. We can script that if needed. Or even set autoscaling (Fly has experimental autoscale).
* **Monitoring & Logging:**

#### Monitoring – DataDog, New Relic, Sentry

To ensure reliability, we integrate monitoring for performance, errors, and uptime:

* **DataDog:** A comprehensive monitoring service that can track metrics (CPU, memory, API response times), traces (APM for requests to see where time is spent), and logs.

  * We can use DataDog’s **APM agent** in our app (if using Python, ddtrace library) to automatically instrument our API endpoints and measure DB queries, external API calls, etc. This can help find slow points (maybe a particular API call is slow or our DB query needs indexing).
  * It also monitors infrastructure – if on AWS, easy integration, but on Fly/Railway, we can still send metrics via their API.
  * DataDog has a **dashboard** where we can set up alerts (e.g. if CPU > 90% for 5 min, or if an external API call failure count is high).
  * Cost: DataDog is expensive at scale (like \$15 per host per month, plus \$ per million traces/logs). But they have a free tier for small usage or a trial. Possibly for one host, it might be free or low cost; logs ingestion might cost though. Alternatively, we could use open-source tools (Prometheus + Grafana) but that's heavy to maintain ourselves. DataDog saves time.
  * If budget is a concern, we can start with just basic alerts via uptime monitoring (below) and use Sentry for errors, and only add DataDog APM later.
* **New Relic:** Similar to DataDog in APM and infrastructure monitoring. They have a perpetual free tier for 100GB of data/month which is actually quite nice. We might consider New Relic’s free tier to instrument our app. The Python agent will give us performance breakdowns and error tracking (New Relic also captures errors, though Sentry is specialized for that).

  * We should not double instrument (like using two APMs), but one of DataDog or New Relic suffice. New Relic’s free tier might push us that direction initially.
* **Sentry:** This is focused on **error tracking** – capturing exceptions in the code with stack trace, user info, etc., and aggregating them. Sentry is excellent for quickly spotting bugs (like if an endpoint is throwing a 500 due to some edge case, we get an alert and can fix it).

  * Integration: Use Sentry SDK in Python (just a couple lines to init with our DSN). It will catch unhandled exceptions or explicit error captures. We can tag errors with context (e.g. which API call failed).
  * Alerts: Sentry can email or Slack notify when new error types occur or frequency spikes.
  * Cost: Free plan allows some number of events (like 5k errors/month). If our app is stable, that’s fine. If we exceed, paid starts at \$29/mo for more events and features.
  * Given our need for quality (financial analysts will not tolerate glitchy data), Sentry is highly recommended to catch issues early in development and after deployment.
* **Uptime Monitoring:** We should have a simple ping monitoring for our API and maybe key third-party APIs:

  * We can use a free service like **UptimeRobot** (checks site every 5 minutes, free) to alert if our site is down.
  * Or, DataDog/NewRelic can do synthetic checks, but simpler to start with basic.
  * This ensures we know if our platform goes offline or response slows dramatically.

**Integration Summary:**

* We’ll integrate Sentry from day one for error tracking.

* Use either DataDog or New Relic’s APM to monitor performance once we have users (New Relic’s free tier is enticing).

* Possibly push custom metrics – e.g. how many API calls we made to Comtrade today, success vs fail – to monitoring. DataDog API allows sending custom metrics easily, which could help track external API usage and decide if we approach limits or need scaling.

* Use Slack or email notifications from these tools so our devops stays alert to issues.

* **Legal/Security:** We must ensure monitoring tools don’t inadvertently expose user data. For example, Sentry might capture a snippet of an error that includes a query with user’s email or such – we should scrub PII. Both Sentry and DataDog allow filtering of sensitive data. We will configure that (like do not send user passwords or tokens in logs, etc.).

* **Cost:**

  * Sentry: free to start.
  * DataDog vs New Relic: likely free for our small scale until we intentionally upgrade. New Relic’s free includes 1 full user and basic usage which might suffice for quite some time.
  * If we eventually pay for DataDog APM, maybe \$15-20/month for a low host count, which is fine.

#### Summary of Deployment Plan:

We’ll likely host on a **cloud PaaS (Fly.io)** for our app and database, using **Auth0** for auth and **Stripe** for billing. Our code will be continuously deployed from GitHub, and we’ll use **Sentry** + either **New Relic** for monitoring issues. This stack minimizes ops work while giving us flexibility:

* We don’t maintain servers manually (PaaS handles it).
* We rely on proven third-party services for critical but non-core functionality (login, payments, email) – speeding up development, at the cost of some fees which are justifiable.
* We maintain data ownership and can export/move services if needed (e.g. could move from Auth0 to self-hosted later if cost demands, or from Fly to AWS, etc., since our code is containerized and our data in standard Postgres/S3).

All these infrastructure components have **APIs themselves** that we could use to automate management tasks (like scale out/in, or retrieving metrics), but day-to-day we’ll mostly interact through their dashboards and configuration rather than coding against those APIs extensively.

---

Having detailed each category of required APIs and services, we now consolidate how this forms a **comprehensive semiconductor trade monitor** platform:

* **Primary trade data** (Comtrade, DataWeb, Eurostat, Taiwan, Korea): provide the backbone databases of official trade flows, updated promptly after release, ensuring full coverage of countries and HS codes (with focus on 8542, 854231/39, 848620).
* **Supplemental shipment data** (Panjiva/ImportGenius, AIS): fill the real-time gap, capturing shipment movements within days or hours, for a forward-looking edge.
* **Contextual economic data** (FRED, World Bank, IMF): enrich analysis with macro trends (so users see not just that “exports fell 10%” but also maybe “global semiconductor sales fell 8%” or “GDP shrank – context for trade drop”).
* **Geopolitical/News feed** (GDELT, news APIs): provide narrative context and alerts on events that numbers alone would lag (policy changes, disasters, etc.).
* **User & DevOps infrastructure** (Auth0, Stripe, etc.): ensure a seamless user experience in accessing the data (secure login, upgrade to premium easily) and a smooth operation (monitoring, error alerts for us).

Next, we’ll address some **critical questions** explicitly to ensure all concerns are covered, then present an implementation roadmap with priorities, cost estimates, and risk mitigation.

## Critical Questions Answered

**1. Real-time (<12 hour) semiconductor trade data – which APIs can provide it?**
Official customs APIs do not provide sub-daily updates (they are at best daily or monthly). To get <12h latency, we rely on **alternative data**:

* **Shipment tracking APIs (Panjiva/ImportGenius)** – U.S. customs data is updated daily (so \~24h latency). While not under 12h in all cases, it’s close; sometimes manifests are available within hours of clearance. For near-real-time within the same day, **AIS shipping data** (MarineTraffic) can show that a ship carrying goods has departed/arrived in real time – but that’s an indirect proxy (doesn’t give trade value immediately).
* **News/Event APIs (GDELT)** – For policy changes affecting trade, GDELT gives essentially real-time alerts within minutes.
* In summary, **no public trade stat API gives data within 12h of the transaction** (customs need to process entries). However, by combining **daily shipment data** and **real-time news/ship tracking**, we achieve effectively real-time monitoring of the supply chain. For example, if an export ban is enacted at 9am, GDELT/Reuters news API will reflect that by 9:15am, and we alert users. Or if suddenly shipments of a certain HS code drop to zero one week, we’d see fewer daily bills of lading, indicating an immediate change – whereas official monthly data would only confirm it weeks later.
* Also note, some countries (like **China**) have near-real-time trade data releases (China Customs sometimes gives first 10 days of the month trade early). If needed, we can incorporate such sources from news or official announcements.

**2. Most cost-effective API combination for comprehensive coverage:**
We prioritize **free and open APIs** for baseline coverage of all needed data, and use **paid APIs selectively** for added value. A cost-effective stack:

* **UN Comtrade + DataWeb + Eurostat + Korea/Taiwan APIs** – covers global trade flows at no cost except our implementation time. This gives us comprehensive historical and recent data for virtually all trade corridors (albeit with slight delays).
* **ImportGenius API** instead of Panjiva – ImportGenius at \~\$399-\$899/month provides granular shipment data at a fraction of Panjiva’s cost. We lose some advanced features, but for raw data on shipments, it suffices. If budget is tight, we might even start without it, but then we sacrifice real-timeness. Given our platform’s value proposition of near-real-time, the ImportGenius cost is justified and much cheaper than building a global logistics data collection ourselves.
* **GDELT** – free, huge value for zero cost.
* **FRED & World Bank** – free macro data.
* **Auth0 Developer plan** – free or \$23/mo (small cost for critical auth).
* **Stripe** – no monthly fee, just a cut of revenue.
* **SendGrid/Twilio** – pay-per-use; initially within free tier (cost = \$0), scaling linearly as users use alerts (e.g. \$10 or \$20 a month when we have thousands of notifications, which is fine).
* **Hosting** – Fly.io or Railway free tier covers a lot. Possibly our biggest fixed cost might be a DB hosting if outgrowing free (maybe \$20-50/mo).
* **Monitoring** – New Relic’s free tier vs DataDog’s paid; we can try free options first to avoid cost. Sentry is free until volume grows.

In total, we could run this platform with essential features at maybe **<\$1k per month** in API/service costs initially (mostly the ImportGenius subscription). That is very cost-effective given the breadth of coverage. As users and data scale, costs will rise (especially if using more commercial data or upgrading service tiers), but presumably revenue offsets that.

**3. APIs offering granular HS code data (HS-6, HS-8, HS-10):**

* **UN Comtrade**: HS-6 primarily (the internationally reported level). Some countries’ data might include HS-8/10 if they volunteer it, but generally 6. Good for broad analysis, not as granular as needed for product specifics.
* **US DataWeb**: offers **full 10-digit HTS** detail. We can get, say, 8542320010 vs 8542320090 if those existed (just as an example of splitting). This covers our need for deep detail for U.S. flows.
* **Eurostat Comext**: provides **CN8** (which is detailed enough to differentiate many tech products) and even CN10 for some internal purposes. CN8 will cover more than HS6, so definitely granular.
* **Taiwan MOF**: Likely provides at least **HS-8** (their system uses 8-digit codes). Possibly more, but 8-digit is likely (which is fine since Taiwan’s 8-digit will differentiate specific memory types etc., we need to confirm code definitions).
* **Korea Customs**: Not via open API for HS codes. However, we can rely on Comtrade for Korea’s HS-6. If needed, KCS publishes more granular data on their website (probably HS-10 in monthly Excel). If critical, we can attempt to parse those. For now, assume HS6 from Comtrade as fallback.
* **Panjiva/ImportGenius**: These give **HS-10** (or whatever the full code is in each country’s manifest). For example, a U.S. shipment might show 8542320050 (a specific type of memory). That’s extremely granular. Also, the textual description on manifests sometimes states product model or specifics, which is beyond code.
* **IMF DOTS/World Bank**: These are aggregate at total trade or broad categories, not granular. So not for HS detail.

So our solution is: use national APIs for maximum detail where possible (U.S. 10-digit, EU 8-digit, etc.), and complement with bill-of-lading data for company-level detail and any additional granularity (like exact product descriptions). For countries where only HS-6 is available (Korea via Comtrade), we acknowledge that limitation. If needed, we might source HS-10 from KITA if possible, but that might not be easily available publicly.

**4. Legal/licensing restrictions for commercial use:**
We must ensure compliance with each data source:

* **UN Comtrade, Eurostat, World Bank, IMF** – These are open data. They generally permit commercial use with attribution and ask not to use their logos in a misleading way. We will cite them as needed (e.g., in our methodology page list sources and their attributions). No serious restrictions; we just cannot claim their data as our proprietary data.
* **US DataWeb** – U.S. government data (public domain). No issues using it or even repackaging it. We should show source as US Census/ITC but it’s not legally required.
* **Taiwan, Korea customs** – These are government open data as well (with explicit statements of no license restriction for Korea, and likely similar for Taiwan). We’re fine to use commercially. They likely expect attribution if possible ("Source: Taiwan MOF Customs Statistics"), which we will provide in documentation.
* **ImportGenius/Panjiva** – Strict **license agreements** will apply. Typically:

  * We can use the data internally and display insights to our end-users, but we **cannot resell or redistribute the raw data**. For example, we shouldn’t allow a user to download all Panjiva records from our platform, as that competes with Panjiva directly.
  * We probably cannot publicly post individual shipment details verbatim beyond a certain limit. But showing a few as examples or aggregated numbers (like “50 shipments from Samsung to TSMC this month”) should be acceptable usage because it’s derivative analysis.
  * We have to include a **copyright notice** if required (Panjiva’s terms might require “© S\&P Global” on any data point sourced).
  * If we discontinue partnership, we might have to delete data from them.
  * Also, data privacy: Panjiva data might include company names (which are not personal data, but if it included any personal names on bills of lading – sometimes small consignees – we should handle that carefully under privacy laws).
* **GDELT** – Open data, but content it points to (news articles) is copyrighted by publishers. We circumvent infringement by only showing titles or small excerpts and linking to the source (which is allowed as fair use / news reporting). We should not store full text of articles.
* **Reuters/Bloomberg (if any)** – If we used them, we’d have to abide by their contract. Likely they’d allow showing headlines and first 300 characters for our users, with proper attribution (“Source: Reuters”). Anything beyond would be violation. Without a contract, we won’t use their content directly except via GDELT or RSS (which effectively is their allowed public content).
* **Auth0/Firebase/Stripe etc.** – These impose that we handle user data according to privacy policies and don’t misuse their service (e.g., no fraudulent charges, etc.). We will have terms of service and privacy policy on our platform to cover these aspects (especially since we handle personal data like emails and possibly payment info via Stripe).
* **SendGrid/Twilio** – If we send SMS or emails, we must comply with anti-spam laws. That means only sending to users who opt-in, providing unsubscribe for marketing emails, etc. We will enforce that by not abusing those channels.
* **In sum,** we’ll have to incorporate language from these providers in our user-facing terms (e.g., “Data sources include XYZ; © respective owners; you, the user, are not permitted to scrape or resell the data from our platform in raw form either”).
* Additionally, to protect ourselves: we likely will include a disclaimer that while we use these authoritative sources, the platform is not an official source and we aren’t liable for decisions made based on the data (given markets can move on this info, we want to disclaim responsibility for absolute accuracy, though we strive for it).

**5. Reliability and uptime records:**
We aim to choose APIs with proven reliability:

* **UN Comtrade** – Generally reliable for what it is, but as noted, heavy queries can fail. We mitigate by caching and using backups. But Comtrade service itself is stable (they wouldn’t have survived decades if not).
* **US DataWeb** – Solid uptime, occasionally locked during data loads (we know those times are when new data comes, which might be off-business hours).
* **Eurostat** – Very robust, two updates a day routine, rarely down (maybe short maintenance occasionally).
* **Taiwan/Korea** – the open data portals have good uptime. Korea’s is national infrastructure used by many devs, should be reliable. Taiwan’s website approach might be less API-like, but that site is maintained as the official trade stats site – likely high uptime. It might be slow if many users query at once, but our automated fetch is infrequent.
* **ImportGenius/Panjiva** – As paid enterprise services, they maintain high uptime. Their clients (including big companies) rely on them. We can expect near 24/7 availability. If maintenance is needed, they likely schedule and inform.
* **GDELT** – It’s research-based, but it’s on Google Cloud and has been running continuously for years, updating on time. There have been a few outages historically (e.g. when a server move happened) but generally it’s consistent. We will not solely rely on it for critical alerts without verification (e.g. ideally cross-check important news with another source).
* **FRED/World Bank/IMF** – All these official sources have excellent uptime. Fed and WB are known to have near 100% uptime for their APIs (with occasional short service windows).
* **Auth0/Stripe** – These SaaS services advertise 99.9% uptime and have redundant setups (Stripe in particular is highly reliable in processing).
* **SendGrid/Twilio** – They are cloud-based, distributed. Twilio can have regional SMS carrier issues, but generally up. We should monitor if any alert fails to send and retry or send via email as fallback.
* **Our own** – we will incorporate redundancy where possible (maybe have multiple instances across regions, especially if using Fly). Using monitoring as described ensures we catch any downtime quickly.

**6. Backup data sources if primary APIs fail:**
We touched on many in each section, but summarizing the backup strategy:

* **If UN Comtrade is down or missing new data** – Use individual country sources (like our other primary APIs). Also, **WTO or ITC** annual data as stop-gap if needed. We also plan to keep a local database of historical data so we aren’t reliant on Comtrade for past values in real-time.
* **If US DataWeb is unavailable** – Could use **Census’s API** for some high-level numbers (Census has an API for international trade in goods by country, which is separate, but it’s aggregated, not by HS). For detailed, we could use **Panjiva/ImportGenius** to estimate US trade (since they have actual import shipment values which can be summed – though they might not exactly match official totals due to coverage and valuation differences, but close). We also could wait since downtime likely short. Another fallback: **USA Trade Online** web portal, but that’s manual.
* **If Eurostat API fails** – Use **national statistics** (each EU country has monthly releases). For example, if we needed Germany’s data urgently and Eurostat is down, we could get it from Destatis which publishes detailed data about the same time. But that’s lots of separate sources. Alternatively, rely on our last downloaded CSV or Comtrade (EU countries report to Comtrade too, albeit some months lag). So short-term fallback: use cached data until Eurostat returns.
* **Taiwan** – If automated fetch fails, set an alert to manually retrieve from their site. There might also be *semi-official channels*: e.g. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs sometimes publishes a **monthly trade summary in PDF** which includes by product category. Not as granular, but at least something.
* **Korea** – If their API or portal fails, we have **UN Comtrade** for Korea (with a lag). Also KITA’s website as manual fallback. Or simply wait a day; the portal is unlikely to be down long.
* **Panjiva/ImportGenius** – If we don’t have one, use the other. If both were unreachable (say an API issue), we still have official data albeit slower. For immediate short outage, no big harm – just our real-time view might freeze briefly. We can notify users if that component is down and being resolved. The risk of both failing simultaneously is low.
* **MarineTraffic AIS** – If down, other AIS providers can be switched fairly quickly (we’d just need to change API endpoint and key). We could also temporarily lack vessel tracking and that’s not as critical as trade data.
* **News (GDELT)** – If GDELT is down, rely on direct RSS from top news sources as interim. Possibly encourage users to view an integrated Twitter feed for breaking news in industry (another idea: embed a Twitter list of semiconductor reporters, since Twitter often breaks news – but Twitter API nowadays is paid, so maybe not).
* **Auth0/Stripe** – These have high redundancy. If Auth0 is down (rare), users can’t log in – we’d have to wait or if prolonged, implement a quick backup login method (not trivial). Possibly have a static “read-only mode” for data if Auth0 is out – e.g., allow viewing last cached data without needing login (for free data). But since paying users and their data maybe, likely just rely on Auth0’s reliability (they historically have been very stable).
* **Stripe down** – People can’t subscribe or maybe payments fail temporarily. We can queue those requests or show a message to try later. Stripe outages are almost unheard-of beyond a few minutes.
* **Our platform down** – We plan redundancy and monitoring so this doesn’t happen beyond brief maintenance. But if our hosting is disrupted, we have daily backups and can redeploy on a different host quickly (e.g., if Fly.io has an outage, we could spin up on AWS with docker in worst case).

Essentially, because we combine multiple sources, an outage in one doesn’t cripple the whole platform; we might lose some data or freshness temporarily but can advise users accordingly. We’ll also design the UI to clearly label last update times per data series, so if something’s stale (due to a source issue), users see it and we can provide explanation if needed (transparency builds trust).

**7. Minimizing API costs while maximizing coverage:**
We do this via:

* **Leverage free data first.** All core trade volume data come from free APIs (as detailed). This covers 90% of use cases without paying per record.
* **Use commercial APIs only for value-add realtime or detail**. ImportGenius is the main cost, but we choose it because it significantly enhances timeliness and detail which free sources cannot. We picked the more cost-effective provider for that need.
* **Optimize use of paid APIs**:

  * For ImportGenius, use targeted queries. E.g., don’t pull all shipments globally; focus on our HS codes and key routes. That keeps within our subscription’s fair use and avoids needing a higher plan or extra charges.
  * Use caching – if we pull data from ImportGenius for a given day’s shipments, store it in our DB so we don’t request it again. Their API "unrestricted" means no set limit, but it’s good to reduce needless calls for performance too.
  * Use lower-cost proxies for some info. For example, to gauge something like “how busy are ports”, we might not need a pricey API – we could derive an estimate from AIS data (counts of vessels at port) which we already have via MarineTraffic.
  * Another ex: rather than get a macro series from some paid provider, get it from FRED for free. Or rather than subscribing to an expensive news API, use GDELT.
* **Freemium tier for users**: By having a free tier for our users with limited features (e.g. they see aggregate data but not real-time specifics), we can attract users without incurring too much incremental cost (since showing them last month’s data from free sources costs us nothing). Save the costly data for paid users who justify it. For instance, we might only run ImportGenius queries for paying users or for internal analysis that goes into premium reports.
* **Bulk data storage**: We will locally store big chunks of data (which is cheaper than repeatedly calling APIs). For instance, download all historical trade data once (free but time-consuming) and store it, so we don’t repeatedly call Comtrade for historical queries. Similarly, store each month’s new official data internally after fetching – building our own growing repository. This not only improves speed but reduces calls.
* **Monitor usage**: Use the monitoring tools to see if any particular API call is happening excessively. Maybe a bug causes too frequent calls to Comtrade – fix that to not waste bandwidth or risk getting blocked. Or see if we are under-utilizing some expensive data – if so, maybe downgrade that service.
* **Negotiate or choose plans wisely**: For example, ImportGenius had multiple plan levels – start with Premium \$399/mo, if we find we need global data extensively, move to Enterprise \$899/mo, but if not using that many countries, maybe we stick to a lower plan and manually add certain country data. They listed that additional countries in lower plans can be unlocked by talking to sales – perhaps a la carte approach: e.g. if we care about 5 countries outside US, we might be able to add them to a mid-tier plan for cheaper than the full global plan. So we can tailor the subscription to exactly our needs.
* **Open-source solutions**: For some tasks like basic uptime monitoring, use free tools first (like UptimeRobot instead of paying DataDog Synthetics). For error logging, free Sentry vs expensive New Relic logging.
* **Graceful degradation**: If a paid API quota is exceeded (say hypothetically ImportGenius had one and we hit it), we design the platform to gracefully degrade to using only official data (with a note like “Real-time shipment data not available at the moment”). This way we don’t automatically incur massive overage fees. We’d then decide whether to upgrade plan or live without until reset.

**8. Bulk downloads vs real-time streaming support:**
Which APIs support bulk retrieval vs those suited for streaming:

* **Bulk downloads**:

  * **UN Comtrade** provides bulk files by year (not via API but via their site). We will use that for initial historical data load.
  * **Eurostat Comext** provides monthly bulk CSV files – we will fetch those if needed for history or large queries.
  * **World Bank** API can return bulk (like all years for all countries for an indicator) by looping or using their bulk download site (they offer entire WDI as CSV too).
  * **IMF** also has bulk downloadable datasets (e.g. whole DOTS database as an SDMX file).
  * **Panjiva/ImportGenius** – Panjiva can deliver bulk data via data feeds (XpressFeed, etc.) which is not real-time but comprehensive. ImportGenius doesn’t publicly say bulk, but one could likely arrange a data dump if needed. But those are more if we wanted to ingest entire database (which we likely don’t, we focus on selective retrieval).
  * **Auth0, etc.** not relevant for bulk.
* **Real-time streaming**:

  * **GDELT** is effectively streaming (data every 15 min, and one could set up a continuous pull).
  * **AIS (MarineTraffic)** can be polled frequently for near-live data. They also offer a streaming websocket for live data if needed (costly enterprise option usually).
  * **Some news APIs** (if we used, e.g. Twitter’s API streaming, but we’re avoiding Twitter’s new high fees).
  * Our own platform might implement streaming of updates to users via WebSockets or SSE (for example, if a new data point arrives, push to web dashboard without user needing to refresh). That’s something to implement, but the source data ingestion is still at intervals, not continuous. However, for the user, it feels real-time if we push it as soon as we get it.

So, **supporting bulk vs streaming**:

* We will use **bulk for initial data population and heavy historical queries** to reduce API load (e.g. load last 10 years of trade data via one bulk file instead of 120 API calls).
* Use **streaming/real-time APIs for current awareness** (e.g. constantly monitor GDELT and shipments).
* This hybrid ensures we cover both broad and immediate needs efficiently.

**Executive Summary of Recommended Stack:**

Combining the above, our recommended stack uses **free official APIs (UN Comtrade, US DataWeb, Eurostat, etc.) for global historical and baseline data**, augmented by **ImportGenius for daily granular shipment records**, **GDELT for real-time news events**, and **MarineTraffic for live logistics**. This gives us comprehensive coverage from macro trends down to individual shipments, at a sustainable cost. Surrounding this data core, we leverage **cloud services (Auth0, Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)** to handle user management and operations cheaply and reliably, allowing the team to focus on analysis features. This approach maximizes use of open data and low-cost services while strategically deploying paid resources where they yield the highest value (timeliness and detail), thereby creating a powerful yet cost-efficient semiconductor trade monitor platform.

## Implementation Plan and Prioritization

To deliver the platform, we prioritize implementation in stages:

* **Phase 1 (Foundation, Priority 1):**

  * **Database & Core Data Ingestion:** Set up our database schema for trade data (e.g. tables for country, product, monthly trade values, plus tables for daily shipments). Implement scripts to pull **historical data** from **UN Comtrade/Eurostat** for key HS codes and countries (to have baseline trends). Also load any static reference data (HS code descriptions, country codes). This establishes our primary dataset.
  * **Backend API & Basic UI:** Develop the backend (Python Flask/FastAPI or Node, etc.) to serve data to a frontend. Start with essential endpoints: e.g. `/trade?country=KR&partner=TW&hs=854232` returning timeseries, etc. Build a simple front-end dashboard showing a few sample charts. This will use the historical data we loaded. At this stage, we rely solely on free data (which might be slightly older) but ensures functionality.
  * **Auth Integration:** Implement **Auth0 (or Firebase)** for user login. Initially, all users might be treated the same (since we haven’t introduced paid tier yet). Ensure we can create accounts and secure the API endpoints.
  * **Basic Monitoring & Error handling:** Integrate **Sentry** for error tracking early, so we catch issues as we test. Set up an UptimeRobot ping for our API.

* **Phase 2 (Real-Time Enhancements, Priority 1):**

  * **Commercial API Integration:** Integrate **ImportGenius API** to start pulling **latest shipments**. Design a job (or use webhooks if they have, but likely we poll daily) to fetch shipments for our target HS codes and routes. Insert these into our DB. Expose new endpoints or UI elements for “live shipments” or “estimated current month trade” (using partial data).
  * **News & Events:** Integrate **GDELT Event API** queries. For example, set up a periodic job (every hour) that searches for a set of keywords: “semiconductor OR chip OR lithography OR export control OR specific company names (TSMC, ASML, etc.)”. Filter those results and store relevant ones (with title, link, date) in an “events” table. Create a front-end component to display recent important news. Possibly allow filtering by theme (trade policy vs natural disaster, etc., which we can infer from GDELT themes).
  * **Notifications and Alerts:** Implement a simple **email alert** system using **SendGrid**. Perhaps start with one type: e.g. a **weekly summary email** of notable changes (top increases/decreases in trade, key news). Also, allow user to opt in to immediate alerts for major events (this could be triggered by certain keywords from GDELT or threshold in data). This is also where we’d integrate Twilio if doing SMS, but that could be later if needed (initially email might suffice).
  * **Front-end improvements:** Make the UI more interactive: add the ability for users to select different HS codes or country pairs and see charts. Show last update time for each data series. Highlight if new data arrived (e.g. “July data now available!” banner).
  * **Caching & Performance:** Implement caching on our backend for heavy queries (maybe just in-memory or using Redis if needed) to avoid repeatedly calling external APIs for the same data. E.g., cache Comtrade results for some time. Also ensure our database queries are optimized (add indexes for keys like hs\_code, country, year, etc.).
  * **Testing & QA:** By end of Phase 2, we have a feature-complete product (free data + real-time flows + news). We should do rigorous testing: compare our numbers with official sources for sanity (ensuring ingestion is correct), simulate various user flows, and security testing for auth (no data leaks).
  * **Monitoring (extended):** Possibly integrate **New Relic APM** to watch performance in this beta stage and catch any slow endpoints or memory issues.

* **Phase 3 (Premium Features & Scaling, Priority 2):**

  * **Stripe Subscription Implementation:** Now that the core platform is functional, enable the **freemium model**. Decide what features/data are premium (likely the real-time shipment data and alerts are premium, whereas monthly official data and basic charts might be free). Use **Stripe API** to set up at least one paid plan. Integrate Stripe checkout so a free user can upgrade to premium. Also enforce in our backend: check user’s subscription level (Auth0 can store a “plan” claim, or we query our DB which we populate via Stripe webhooks) to decide if they can access certain endpoints (like detailed shipment records or advanced analytics). Test the whole payment flow (with Stripe test cards) and the downgrade/upgrade logic.
  * **User API & API Keys:** If we plan to offer an API for users (so they can programmatically query our data), implement an **API key system**. Possibly a simple solution: each premium user can generate an API key from their account page. That key is stored hashed in DB. We then allow requests like `GET /api/data?...&api_key=KEY` to retrieve JSON. This broadens our product to those who want to ingest our aggregated data into their systems. We can rate-limit this API (maybe via a middleware or use a service like AWS API Gateway with usage plans). This is a value-add that could attract users (especially quant analysts who want data feeds). It’s not strictly required if we focus on UI, but it’s often expected for a data platform and can be a selling point for premium tier (“API access to all data”).
  * **Analytics & Reports:** Build more advanced analytics features: e.g. a **“dashboard” builder** where users can save a set of charts (like one tracking HBM trade between all three focus routes on one page). Or a **report generation** tool that outputs a PDF summary each month. These could differentiate our platform for paying users. APIs involved might include a charting library or an HTML-to-PDF service (like using Puppeteer in code). Not external APIs per se, more internal development.
  * **Alternative Data Integration (if needed, Priority 3):** If feedback suggests, maybe integrate one more data source. For example, maybe **SEMI’s semiconductor sales data** (if publicly available, often they release global sales of chips monthly via WSTS – that might be scraped or gotten from FRED). Or **inventory levels** from some industry surveys. These could further enhance context. This is lower priority but could be done if time.
  * **Scaling Infrastructure:** As user count grows, ensure we allocate more resources:

    * Might move from Fly.io free-tier to paid VMs or replicate across regions.
    * Set up automated backups for DB (if not already).
    * If needed, implement a CDN for static content (though mostly our data is dynamic). Possibly cache certain heavy computed results on CDN if appropriate.
    * If traffic is high, consider load balancing or moving to AWS fully (depending on where bottlenecks are). This is future-looking; initially one server may handle it.
  * **Enhanced Monitoring & Support:** With real users, set up more alerting: e.g. integrate with Slack or PagerDuty for critical outages. Also set up a support email or chat (maybe using something like Intercom or just a mailto) in case users have issues or questions about data. This isn’t an API but part of service.
  * **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:** Finally, continuously review risks:

    * Data risk: what if a data source changes format or policy? E.g., if UN Comtrade changes API version, we need to adapt quickly. Maintain good relationship with providers if possible (subscribe to their newsletters or announcements).
    * Security risk: ensure our auth and data are secured (conduct a security audit if possible, e.g. no open endpoints exposing sensitive info).
    * Performance risk: monitor that our external API usage stays within limits (like not hitting any Comtrade hourly limit inadvertently).
    * Have contingency funds or plans if we need to suddenly swap an API (say ImportGenius goes out of business, we could switch to another provider or rely on more internal analysis for short term).

* **Phase 4 (Future enhancements, Priority 3):** (beyond initial deployment)

  * Possibly integrate **machine learning** insights, e.g. forecasting future trade flows or anomaly detection. Could use libraries or an API like Facebook Prophet or others for forecasting – but those run internally, not external API.
  * Add more **data sources**: e.g. **macro forecasts** (IMF/WB outlooks), **company financials** (if we want to correlate a company’s export performance with its stock, that would mean pulling financial data from an API like Yahoo Finance or alpha vantage – an idea for premium analysis).
  * **Community or collaboration features**: e.g. allow users to comment on charts or share their dashboards. This might integrate with external auth (like sign in with LinkedIn) to foster a community – lower priority but can drive adoption if done.

* **Continual iteration:** After launch, gather user feedback and iterate, possibly adjusting which APIs we use more of or less of. E.g. if users care a lot about port congestion, maybe we’d integrate a dedicated container throughput data source. Or if a certain official source is unreliable, find a backup. Being agile in integrating new APIs or replacing ones is key to a long-term robust platform.

Now, addressing **Risks for each API dependency and mitigation** (part of risk assessment):

* **UN Comtrade risk:** Data lag or API downtime. *Mitigation:* Use direct country data when possible; maintain local cache; if Comtrade completely fails, as last resort, rely on mirror sources like World Bank’s WITS (which might have some Comtrade data).
* **US DataWeb risk:** Possibly login credentials expiration or API changes (but since it’s maintained by USITC, likely stable). *Mitigation:* Monitor their announcements; have automated tests for data retrieval each month and if fails, be ready to fetch via the web interface as backup.
* **Eurostat risk:** Low, maybe the complexity of API. *Mitigation:* Already plan to use monthly CSV if needed.
* **Taiwan risk:** Most risky integration due to lack of official API. *Mitigation:* If our scraping fails one month, allocate someone to manually retrieve it promptly; consider reaching out to Taiwan’s officials if we gain some clout to request an API (maybe not initially but if platform is recognized, they might provide data more easily).
* **Korea risk:** They might change API structure slightly if they update versions. *Mitigation:* Keep an eye on data.go.kr for any new versions or announcements. They usually version their endpoints (like v1, v2) – we should use the latest and be ready to adapt.
* **ImportGenius risk:** Data might not cover certain country we eventually want, or contract issues. *Mitigation:* Keep Panjiva or other competitor in mind; maybe have a trial of Panjiva parallel (if affordable) to validate data quality differences.
* **GDELT risk:** Noise or false positives. *Mitigation:* Filter carefully by credible sources or double-source critical news with another feed (like ensure a big news appears on Reuters or official statement, not just one obscure outlet).
* **Auth0 risk:** Pricing if user base skyrockets beyond free. *Mitigation:* Could move to Cognito or self-hosted alternative (Keycloak) later if needed, but that’s heavy. For now, accept cost trade-off for ease. Also, if Auth0 had an outage (rare), we could allow cached login (e.g. token refresh grace or something) but that’s complicated. We rely on their reliability which is historically very high (Auth0 SLA \~99.99%).
* **Stripe risk:** Payment compliance or user disputes. *Mitigation:* Use Stripe’s built-in tools for fraud prevention, have a clear refund policy. If Stripe was down (very unlikely), users could use the product in trial mode and subscribe a bit later – not a big risk to data, just to revenue.
* **SendGrid/Twilio risk:** Possibly email going to spam (we need to warm up our sending domain, use good practices). Twilio: messages not delivered if DND or regulatory issues in some countries. *Mitigation:* Provide email as fallback if SMS fails; and ensure email deliverability by authentication and not spamming.
* **Data Accuracy risk:** If any API provides erroneous data (it happens occasionally, e.g. a country revises data drastically), our platform might show outlier. *Mitigation:* We can implement basic sanity checks (if a value jumps extraordinarily, maybe flag it as potential anomaly or footnote that “Data might be preliminary or revised”). Also plan to update historical data if sources revise them (Comtrade might update past months; we should refresh those periodically).
* **Privacy and Security:** We hold user emails, maybe names, and Stripe holds payment info. We must secure our database (no open ports, use TLS everywhere, etc.). Use monitoring to detect any unusual access. Comply with privacy laws (GDPR etc. – likely include a cookie consent if we have EU users, and allow data deletion if requested).

By considering all these factors, we have a robust blueprint for the platform. We’ve chosen APIs that are current as of 2025, leveraging their latest versions and capabilities (ensuring data freshness and relevance), and we’ve planned around their limitations with complementary sources.

Finally, the **Integration Architecture** in summary:
Our system will have an **ETL pipeline** fetching data from primary APIs on schedule (monthly for official stats, daily for shipments, minutes for news). This flows into our **database** where data is harmonized (common country and HS code references across sources). The web/backend app then **serves queries** from this DB (using recent data inserted from APIs). Users interact via the front-end which calls our backend API. The backend also triggers outgoing notifications via email/SMS and manages authentication via Auth0 integration. We use webhooks (Stripe for payments, possibly Auth0 for user provisioning or Stripe to update Auth0 roles upon purchase). Monitoring agents (New Relic/Sentry) run within the backend to feed performance/error data to our dashboards.

We can depict it like:

**Data Layer:** UN Comtrade →|monthly ETL|→ DB; US DataWeb →|monthly ETL|→ DB; … ImportGenius →|daily ETL|→ DB; GDELT/news →|continuous ETL|→ Events DB.
**Backend/API:** Reads from DB (also can directly call some APIs if need real-time on-demand, but mostly uses DB), enforces auth, formats JSON for front-end.
**Frontend:** Dashboard, charts, maps (maybe integrate a charting library, and possibly a map to show shipments or ports).
**User Mgmt:** Auth0 secure endpoints, user tokens flow with requests for auth.
**Billing:** User clicks upgrade, front-end calls our backend → Stripe Checkout session → user pays → Stripe webhook → our backend marks user as premium in Auth0 or DB → user now sees premium data.
**Notifications:** Cron jobs or event triggers in backend decide to send email (via SendGrid) or SMS (Twilio) or push webhook on certain conditions.
**Monitoring/Logging:** Sentry catches any error, sends to dev; NewRelic/DataDog catches performance metrics and we set alerts if needed.

This architecture ensures each piece is decoupled and scalable: data ingestion can be scaled or queued, the web app can scale separately, and external services handle heavy tasks (auth, payments, mailing) which keeps our maintenance lower.

We’ve now fully addressed the tasks, and the platform is poised to provide near-real-time, granular trade intelligence on semiconductors in a reliable and scalable manner.
